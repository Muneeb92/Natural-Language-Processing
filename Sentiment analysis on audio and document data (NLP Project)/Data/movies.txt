Movies_TV	POS	5	my boy love this film . sometime my youngest get scared of Captain Hook . the story be great , and I think little boy can really connect to it . beautiful , fun music as well .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	on my disk the last scene of episode 2 : New Earth be miss . instead the disk cut to a gory scene from what appear to be `` the Texas Chainsaw Massacure '' . look at the dvd menue I see that the last scene be title `` Time to die '' . I can only guess that the manufacturer of the dvd insert a simularly title scene from another movie . parent be warn , the scene in question be NOT for child .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I have a 4yr old son and he love this cartoon , and I too i buy it because of the story its so intresting .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this sequal be wonderful . the animation be excellent , though other may comment that it be not correct to the original style . I hate to be the one to point this out , but we be no longer in the 50 's decade . animation have come a long way since then , so of course it will look sharper . from a artist 's standpoint , there be such subtly and depth to each scene that , storyline aside , it be delightful to watch - especially character reaction . as for the story , it be clean -lrb- which be a rarety in and of itself -rrb- as well as entertaining . the plot take a fun twist on what would happen if the wand be in another 's hand and really try to prove that even without magical assistance , Cinderella could still hold she own . and be not that what the 50 's version be attempt to point out as well ? I do not think this movie detract from the original , but instead be a fun , relax form of entertainment . however , to be fair , the only part I find irritating be the change in the mouse 's diction . that be the only change that I find annoying enough to mention . that aside , it be nice to see a woman fight for she dream and get they - and a prince with a personality to boot ! so I would recommend this movie to those who just want a clean , fun , and intelligent source of entertainment for themselves as well as they child .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I really hope sci-fi never take off the doctor . this be the best show on tv !!!!! I will be buy this once I can afford it ! I could watch they over and over ! Rose be awesome !! once again BBC win .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	Disney be definitely let down the dvd communtiy compare to other company . aside from some artwork , this dvd have nothing else on it except the movie itself . good heaven for the price Disney charge , there should be a paint cell from the movie come with the dvd .  the story itself be a classic . the animation have not hold up all that well , though I think some of that have to be due to the introduction of computer animation .  none of the song be really noteworthy .
Movies_TV	POS	5	the prior reviewer need a little schooling in widescreen . the 1st . true widescreen film be the robe in Cinemascope 1953 and follow by how to marry a Millionaire both by 20th Century Fox who own the process . not the King & I. by 1956 widescreen be in full swing with most of the study either use cinemascope or use one of they own . quite possibly disney could give this film a matting since the industry standard in film be not 1.33 and tv be not yet a household item at the time . also , disney do produce 2 film in widescreen Lady & The Tramp and sleep Beauty Cinemascope and Technirama . both beautifully do on dvd and vh . so please get you fact straight when make strong statement about other comment .
Movies_TV	POS	5	`` Peter Pan '' , the 2nd Disney Classic that I add to my dvd library be another keeper . another favorite from my childhood , the film be still a great experience to watch . the animation be still classic , as be the story . of course , the appeal of the film have change for I , from what it be when I be a kid . it be now a classic animation film , rather then just a cartoon .  I be suprise with Disney do not announce that this film be go to be part of they `` platinum edition '' , but this dvd -lrb- while no extra -rrb- be still worth the purchase for the film its self . the picture be adequete as be the Dolby Digital Mix -lrb- Adequete for a animated film that be -rrb- .  if you be a dvd Collector , you should strongly consider purchase this dvd , and all of Disney 's classic .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	the instructor be a little annoying , she be make much love to the camera way too often . find it very distracting and uncomfortable , however it feel like a work out . as long as you do not mind some woman make sexy eye at you , you will like this video .
Movies_TV	POS	5	doctor who have return to telelvision after a long hiatus , and it be still `` get it '' , to quote the Doctor himself . the second season\/series be exciting , frightening , dramatic , and fun all at the same time . it be good family entertainment . smaller child might find some of the alien a little frightening , but , as a parent , that would be my only concern with this program . virtually no swearing , no bed hop , or nudity , and at the end of the day , the doctor take a stand and do what he think be right , because he believe that that be what you should do .
Movies_TV	POS	5	purchase this thru rare video in FlA. via Amazon . it be as advertise , English , Widescreen Version , excellent sound & NEW . I would recommend rare video for other dvd 's which be unavailable for purchase in retail or discount store . be thrill to be send to my grandson for he birthday . Forgot what a delightful movie this be until I review it before send it on to he -lrb- 5 yr . old -rrb- .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I remember the older show when I be a kid and use to laugh at the cheesey special effect and costume but all that have change now ! I can not wait for the next season !
Movies_TV	POS	5	how can you go wrong with a story about eternal youth feature pirate , Indians and mermaid ? clumsy hand can ruin even a magnificent story but in this case Disney produce one of cinema 's great masterpiece . Peter Pan be as close to perfection as any film I have ever watch and not only rank number one in my list of Disney animation but be my favorite animated film by any studio even beat out the brilliant spirited away by Hayao Miyazaki . Disney 's Peter Pan have a extremely tight , well pace story without a waste frame or a scene that drag . the animation be bright , active and fluid . I would challenge fan of beauty and the beast and the little mermaid to go back and watch those film again and compare they to Peter Pan which look far better despite be almost 40 year they senior . when I be young I think of Neverland as a literal place while at the same time remove from we reality . in other word it be not simply in the imagination of wendy , John and Michael but be a actual location they fly to just not a place you could ever stumble across . the biggest complaint I have read about the movie be the use of broad stereotype of native Americans but in this case I always consider they more of a archetype of the childhood concept of a indian rather than a real native american tribe since they appear to live exclusively in Neverland . likewise , despite Captain Hook 's vow to sail away from Neverland it be hard to imagine he pirate crew exist anywhere else . I will not battle too hard over the usage of racial stereotype but I really do not think it be a sufficient reason to discount the movie . movie about child , write for child , tend to write child like small , overly clever adult . Peter Pan and the lose boy act like real child . they be impulsive , self centered and easily manipulate -lrb- ok , Peter be a bit more clever than the lose boy -rrb- . when Hook capture the lose boy and seduce they with life as a pirate they gleefully rush to join . even John and Michael trip over themselves to hop aboard . all loyalty to pan seem go . likewise Peter have no problem nuzzle with Tiger Lily right in front of wendy or laugh off when the mermaid attempt to drown she . when Tinker Bell convince the lose boy to try and kill wendy , Peter be not angry over the attempt murder he be angry that tink betray he . it be not that Peter have malice -lrb- although kill hook do not seem to bother he a whit -rrb- it be that Peter be about Peter and even he refusal to grow up can be see as a childish refusal to follow the rule of society and nature . what set Peter apart be that when he decide not to grow up he literally do not grow up . every character , even the peripheral one like big Chief and Tiger Lily , be wonderful . I could watch the interaction of Captain Hook and Smee all day long and although hook be generally play for laugh he be no fool and cleverly manipulate Tinker Bell to reveal Pan 's hideout . what I really love about the character be they unapologetic amorality . this be not a film about life lesson or personal growth . it be simply a fantasy adventure that make no attempt to moralize and I love it . Rottentomatos.com recently have a list of the 75 greatest animated movie and Peter Pan do not even make the cut and hold a very good but not excellent aggregate score of 83 % . I have no idea what movie 17 % of reviewer see but as I lifetime fan of animation Peter Pan be the one film I recommend everyone see . ignore the naysayer .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my daughter be almost 4yrs old and regularly pop this dvd in before she reach for the original Cinderella . now I be not here to take anything away from the original nor do movie review where I attack the storyline etc. . the movie be just what it say , a twist . this be a very vividly animated , too funny and touching spin off . so glad I add it to she collection because its on heavy rotation !
Movies_TV	POS	5	after the departure of Christopher Eccleston , everyone wonder what would happen next , would David Tennant tag over the mantle successfully . the answer be a clear yes . the second series of the hit show contain all 13 episode of the second season plus the 2005 Christmas special . the usual good -lrb- rather than dazzling , there be some omission such as attack of the graske and the tardisode -rrb- set of extra be include . a 5.1 sound mix be also include -lrb- though hopefully it be better than last year 's -rrb- . the episode themselves range from traditional to experimental , not everything work , but it be clearly a show now hit its stride . Roll on the Runaway Bride and series 3 !
Movies_TV	POS	5	Peter Pan be one of the Ultimate Disney classic . the restoration make it even more enjoyable this time around . this be the perfect keepsake ... my child will love grow up watch this !
Movies_TV	POS	4	my young niece Sarah and nephew Caleb be terrify of Walt Disney 's 1953 animated feature , PETER PAN -- the crocodile , a band of pirate , Captain Hook with a hook hand , a rock slide that seem to momentarily kill Tinker Bell . the movie scare they so much in they younger day that they do not want to see it again , and neither do they mother . I , however , as a 56 year old film scholar find the film delightful -- a boy who can fly and refuse to grow up lead the darling kid over nighttime London and to Never-Land , where they all get to fight with indian and pirate . there be a Skull Rock , and a pirate cove , and a beautiful pirate ship . it be all just marvelous for adult . as for the crocodile , he be so stupid , boredly watch hook fight with Peter until Hook fall into the water . and Hook be a irresistible pirate for kid of all age . I love when Peter be on a mountain top pretend to be hook and give order to dopey Smee in a boat below . the glory of this animated film be that it be animated so the wire do not show in spectacular fly sequence , again highlight by `` you can fly '' as the gang fly over 1904 nighttime London , plus the prologue bedroom and all over Never-Land . hook have a real metal hook he deliciously screw on . Tinker Bell be a real , jealous fairy and not a spotlight on stage . and this be the one time Peter be play , satisfyingly and curiously , by a boy and not a grow woman , like Mary Martin on tv or Betty Bronson in a wonderful 1924 silent film version . also unlike , say , the Martin version , you can have spectacular fight sequence and the lose boy and darling kid tie up by the indian , not a lot of wire and paint backdrop . and the animation be magnificent , with deep color and rich detail , especially in this brand-new double disk platinum Edition dvd , which also boast a awesome 5.1 Disney enhance Home Theatre Mix soundtrack . disk one have the restore movie , but also a very informative audio commentary with Roy Disney , Leonard Maltin , John Canemaker , Kathryn `` Wendy '' Beaumont , the woman who model for Tinker Bell , and survive animator . the late Hans Conreid do Captain Hook 's voice to perfection , and Bobby Driscoll do Peter 's . disk two have a good two hour of bonus material , include behind-the-scenes filmmaking documentary , `` why I want to make PETER PAN '' by Walt Disney from the archive , the history of make PETER PAN include storyboard for delete scene that go back to the late 1930 's , a original never-before-seen opening to the movie , and a lovely delete song that songwriter Richard Sherman and singer Paige O'Hara -lrb- Belle in BEAUTY and the beast -rrb- have complete . if Disney have make the movie in the late 1930 's , it would have be very dark and frightening . there be also game and activity galore for child and family , and a fun virtual flight with Peter Pan over London and Never-Land . this PETER PAN have be painstakingly remaster and restore . the 1953 classic have never look nor sound this colorful and tuneful . it belong in every family 's video library , even if it have moment too scary for small child . they will grow into it , at which time it will be back in the Disney vault on seven year moratorium ; buy it now while you can .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I would forget that major plot point in Peter Pan revolve around mysoginistic pre-adolecent female attack on each other and racist stereotype of aboriginal people , so when my three year old pointed to the ` cheifum ' and ask what he be , I be at a loss . if I would say , ` oh , that be a native American , ' she would have think to associate that image with native folk forever , which be a bad thing . I end up tell she he be a ` stereotype ' , and she ask no more . she now refer to he as ` that big guy ' . I can not wait to explain why the mermaid be try to kill wendy . still , the movie have its merit and tinkerbell be pretty popular around here . I would choose many other movie over this one , but compare to such abomination as ` car ' or ` Madagascar ' , the quality of this production be unmistakeable . be aware though - if you child begin push other girl on the playground while chase a particular boy or shout ` how ! ' and pretend to scalp each other , you 'll have this movie to blame for it !!
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have actually have this set in my collection since last November . I be not sure what happen to my original review . I be always leery of the new doctor , have get so comfortable with the previous one whoever that may have be . Chris Eccleston 's doctor be a real triumph and he pairing with Billie Piper be nothing short of inspire . the story be great , take not only the series to new height but tv sci-fus also , so he departure after one season be truly brave , for where be that go to leave the show ? in the hand of a very talented individual by the name of David Tennant , that be where . he doctor explore humanity like never before and it be not since the Green Death that we see he so openly attach to he companion . they separation be a miserable experience for I and , damn , do I want he to tell Rose he feeling for she . she know it , he know it , we all know it but just say it ! the story be of a consistently high standard and some of the Doctor 's line be pure magic -lrb- `` I may die but the moral high ground be mine '' ! -rrb- this show have not only hit its stride but come of age . this be intelligent sci-fus , thoroughly enjoyable , gripping , witty and produce by people who care . the downside be that my set come with a natty little Cyberman head stick on the front -lrb- I could not wait for the US release ! -rrb- . just like the first box , which I also get from Amazon UK , this will not go many round . I take the first set out of the box and put they in separate case to avoid unnecessary wear and tear . perhaps I should do this again . this be a minor quibble , I suppose . the point be that the BBC have produce world-class television . that this television be my favorite ever show be a very good thing . enjoy the show , one episode after another . Tennant 's Doctor rock .
Movies_TV	POS	5	in response to two other reviewer here , the `` if you believe in fairy clap you hand '' scene be in many other version of `` Peter Pan , '' include the various widely-seen tv production , but it be never in the Disney cartoon . those who think it be be mix up they memory .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this series have come a long way since the it debut in the early sixty . who could have know it would still keep go strong , fresh and vigorous into the 21st century ? it alsmost do not . not until a wonderful man by the name Russell T. Davies take the helm of the new project and infuse it with all the wonder , wit and flamboyant eccentricity of the early series . Series 1 of the new Doctor who show that the series could keep its essence and original storytelling without be overwhelm by modern special effect - which be sorely need , though . it also cast some wonderful character to carry the torth . Christopher Eccleston 's Doctor will go down in the annals of who history as the `` Golden Age '' of of the new Doctor who . when he leave at the end of series 1 , David Tennant , who take on the role have some pretty big clog to fill . fortunately , Tennant 's Doctor be as energetic and powerful as Eccleston 's while remain very different . he doctor seem reminiscent of the olde Tom Baker era , and the story he character get into often exude the horror of the Patrick Troughton early year . doctor who be always best when it be scary , something the orginal series seem to drop towards the end in favor of tell story that be just `` weird '' . fortunately the new series know how to exploit its deeper root and bring some incredibly hair-raising moment . Werewolves , Cybermen , and tv 's that suck people 's face off . also , the story be well write , not just rest a cruch of cheap thrill . each story seem to have something intelligent and move to say , something that separate Doctor who from be just a `` Kid 's show '' to something everyone can enjoy . I , for one , be strangely attractd to what be probably the most bizarre episode of series 2 -lrb- nay , the whole series -rrb- , `` love and monster '' . although not tell from the doctor or Rose 's perspective , the intrigue , emotion and charismatic branding of the series be all package neatly into it . it be as bizzare as it be move . but I will not dare spoil it for any of you because it be a epidode , I believe , that be mean to surprise you becuase of its `` uniqueness '' . overall , series 2 have do a fanastic job of open the world of who to old and young alike . for I , someone who come from the fandom of the classic series , I feel like I be rediscover my love of the show without have to relearn it . for my friend , who scarcely glance at the old series , its ageless fun and intellegence -lrb- not to mention update special effect -rrb- have draw they in as well . you be in for quite the romp !
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be a great product . it get the blood pump . some of the step be difficult at first , but you get use to they . I be not in the best shape , so I only do about half of the workout . if you have bad knee , I would advise against this workout . otherwise , this be great .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my whole family love this movie . everyone be glue to the tv especially I since I have not see it for year .
Movies_TV	POS	5	it always strike I that Christopher Eccelston 's Christmas Day interview with the BBC in 2005 -- the day that `` Doctor who '' be reboot for the 21st century -- be ironic . he know , because the complete first season be shoot , that he be not come back ; which be why he mention of the Doctor 's ability to regenerate be so ... tell ... but maybe Chris also have a clue about the come storm that be David Tennant . Tennant 's Doctor -- ten , as other reviewer refer to he -- spiritually do connect back to Tom Baker 's fourth doctor , but David capture a joy in he doctor that Baker do not seem to have . both they doctor seem to understand the `` stream of thought '' concept in line delivery that capture the TimeLord 's essence ... but Tennant have a fun with he interpretation that Baker either be not allow or could not express in he 1974-1981 run . as a result , David push the envelope from where Eccelston have the doctor at the end of he run . while be far more joyful , Tennant also seem to capture the core sadness and anger of the doctor , and those moment seem starker and more striking when they occur . because Russell T. Davies allow ten to be more of a romantic , there be some stunning moment through the season . in many way , `` School Reunion '' and `` the Girl in the fireplace '' play as a two-part episode . `` School Reunion '' bring Elisabeth Sladen back to the Whoniverse as the doctor 's former companion , Sarah Jane Smith , and allow for a discussion -- aside from the main storyline -- that the previous run of Doctor who might not have broach . the scene in which Sarah Jane , sneak through the school at night , discover the TARDIS , and then turn to find Tennant and realize who he be -- be joyous , but quickly turn heartbreaking when Sarah Jane vent at the doctor for leave she ... which in turn , make the doctor talk about he reality -- that he lose those he care about , no matter what . this be a theme that play out in `` the Girl in the fireplace '' , where the TimeLord develop a strong attraction to Sophia Myles ' Madame de Pompadour -lrb- Tennant 's great line after Myles kiss he -- `` I just snog Madame de Pompadour !!! '' -- be a wonderful kick -rrb- . Tennant 's interpretation of the doctor be a wonderful match for Billie Piper 's Rose Tyler . watch the Doctor grow closer to Rose -- we understand he reluctance , but she will not deny she feeling -- be marvelous . Camille Coduri 's Jackie Tyler be scatter and charming , and Noel Clarke 's Mickey Smith mature courageously and sadly through the series -- Mickey come to accept Rose 's attraction to the doctor , but also come to grip with larger responsibility in `` rise of the Cybermen '' and `` the Age of Steel '' that give he a place and purpose . this box set be about the line that open -- and close -- this season , which be why this review be title as such . from the open to the Daleks\/Cybermen smackdown that finish the season in `` Army of ghost '' and `` Doomsday '' , this season allow for a more thorough introduction to the doctor and he world , allow longtime viewer to see the heart -lrb- Hearts , since he have two -rrb- of the preeminent character in british science fiction . though there will always be a element of mystery clouding the doctor , Davies and Tennant allow we to see more of the timelord than we have see over the year ... he strength , he humor , he devotion to life and this planet ... in short , a greater understanding of `` who the ` ell he be ... '' , and this be continue in Tennant 's run in Seasons three and four . this set -- highly recommend .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this movie have it all . twist , action , drama , comedy . very good . whole family can watch together . this be one of my favorite Will Smith Movies .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I can not add anything to the praise for this film . if you love Disney film , this be consider one of the classic . I just wish to briefly comment on the criticism of the lack of a widescreen version . the first widescreen film , the King and I , be release in 1956 . previous to this all film be full screen . Peter Pan , release in 1953 , and a good many of the Disney classic be only available in full screen aspect . this be not the pan and scan alteration of a original Widescreen format . the way this film be present on the dvd be the original aspect ratio ; nothing have be alter . I have see this so call criticism level against many Hollywood classic such as Casablanca , go with the wind and the Wizard of Oz . please , get off you high horse and stop whinn about how Disney or whatever movie company be rip you off . none of these film ever have a widescreen version to begin with . do a little research and you could be content to enjoy these classic in the aspect ratio they be orginally present in . that all I wish to say .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	Disney movie in general be just better than everyone else 's , but not so for sequel . Disney sequel be famously bad , with mediocre music and iffy plot . bad enough to make one wonder : do they just throw this together to prey on the pocket of parent with little girl ? because , really , little girl be the only one who will not notice the gaping plot hole or massive inferiority of this to the original . what really get I be that on every new , fresh Disney movie , you can tell how much time and effort go into it . but sequel just seem to be a attempt to ride the success of the first movie , and this be no different . that say , I force my husband to watch this because it be , indeed , a interesting plotline . it remind I of a whole lot of anime fanfiction I have read -- cool but used idea , never quite live up to expectation , but you kind of have to finish it anyway . I maintain that the movie be watchable and probably very nice for kid , despite my husband 's protest of `` the fairy godmother just throw she wand , and then she be a useless doddering old lady . not magical at all . what kind of fairy godmother just throw she wand ?! '' but what bother ME most be the music -- I could deal with the `` perfectly Perfect '' song at first , but then I realize that the songwriter do not bother to come up with any other lyric . the same song be repeat over and over again , and not with the nice , thematic style that Pocahontas have -- they be actually just the same song alter a WEE bit to fit the situation . mean either the note or the word , but never both . and be anyone else bother by the fact that the prince do not seem to have a name ? or that the wicked stepmother keep say `` Bippity Boppity Boo '' in the most incongruous use of language since the last time President Bush speak in public ? I watch it . I enjoy part , like how the prince have a personality or how Cinderella be willing to fight to get she man . but it be not the Cinderella of Walt Disney 's day . Walt would not have allow this to be put on the market like it be . he have standard .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	the disc be make for eurpeon dvd player and it will not play in the we make dvd player . so it really suck when my kid see the disc and it will not play . my husband use to work in the dvd\/cd production industry so he notice right away the write on the cover be in german that it will not play .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	lot of action and superb and believable acting by Will Smith and Gene Hackman . the best part of the film be see the technology available by the government to do satelite spy , et al. . have a bunch of 19-yr-old do the observe , however be a bit too much of a wishful rip-off of `` sneaker . '' I do not buy it at all , even though I want to .  know that there be literally surveillance everywhere nowadays , it be highly unlikely that assassin with the government would have make a hit in such a public , open place in the first place . some of the premise make sense , but it go everywhere . this film try to be too many thing , part `` sneaker , '' part `` Patriot Games '' and part `` french connection . '' it do not work . the movie be well shoot and those who be satisfy with pyrotechnics , action and spy gadget will still enjoy this film . I like it , but not enough to ever watch it again .
Movies_TV	POS	5	okay , seriously folk . you want to watch this series . I be on the edge of my seat for hour . if you have not see the first season , watch that first ; it help . but do not pass this by . I would write more , but I want to go watch it again .
Movies_TV	POS	4	enemy of the state be a great movie if you like a lot of action , I love the movie . its about a lawyer who be life get twist when he come in counter with a disk that have the murder of the governor . he get help from a man that have be in this situation before and they team up to stay alive . the movie show people what kind of Technology the World have and make you think about the future . the only bad thing about the movie be the timing . enemy of the State should have be just alittle bit longer . I never find myself drift off in the movie and it keep bring more and more action and alittle bit of comedy from Will Smith .  I would recommend this movie to anybody that like action pack movie with lot of adventure .
Movies_TV	POS	5	excellent . great idea of special feature include a read-along with script below . wonderful for early reader . stupendous to be able to obtain for child all one 's childhood favorite in the ORIGINAL , not some politically correct version which insult one 's intelligence .
Movies_TV	POS	5	what could possibly be wrong with this classic . I enjoy it as a kid and watch it with my kid and now as my kid have they own I can not wait to watch it with my grandchild .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Second Series and this doctor be HOT ! there be definitely chemistry between Rose and the doctor but the kid will love watch it too ! if you grow up watch Tom Baker as the Doctor , then you 'll love David Tennant !
Movies_TV	POS	5	great movie . it be deliver in awsome timee I recomend this movie to everyone with kid .
Movies_TV	POS	5	seldom do a sequel live up to the original , but this one do come close . I be a self-proclaimed Disney Fanatic , and when Cinderella III come out , I have want to see it , but be hesitant to buy it because of its predecessor -lrb- the only part of that which I actually like be Anastasia find she happily-ever-after ... -rrb- . wander around the local movie store one night , lo and behold there Cinderella III be on the shelf , give I the perfect opportunity to watch it before I buy it . so I check it out , take it home and watch it . and be more than happy with what Disney create . grant its not the original , but this be still a great story with good animation . so I buy it and now own the movie . this be one that I would love to share with my child in the future . five Stars Disney !
Movies_TV	POS	4	I like every other american teenager grow up with Cinderella . she be and still be my favorite Disney character . the 3rd in the series be certainly entertaining and very charming . it be not the same as the first but almost as good . anyone look at Cinderella 2 do not waste you time .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be always one of my favorite Disney movie . I be happy to say that it be now one of my 2 daughter 's favorite as well . we get the dvd when it come out and they have watch it over and over . all I can say be that I be glad that dvd movie do not wear out like VHS or Beta . the clarity of the image be fantastic . Disney re-release be always beautiful and this be no exception . special feature be great for the adult or older child . a definite must have for any family , but especially for those of we who remember or , more importantly , can not remember what it be like to be a kid .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I see Hemalayaa on Ellen awhile back and that be what make I order this dvd . I try it for the first time last week and have so much fun . if you be just start to exercise , you will not make it through the whole workout . I be a plus-sized woman and find some of the higher impact move extremely hard to do . it be 50 minute long ... I make it in about 20 minute the first time and have to call it quit . by the third time I do the work out I make it up to 35 minute . this dvd make you want to work out because it be so fun and I feel sexy do it ! I be hope as I lose weight I 'll make it all 50 minute !! I 'll be buy at least one more of Hemalayaa 's dvd to create some variety .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be a very fun dance workout dvd !! it get you move and laugh at yourself too . its in a nice format that you can follow and learn the step . I look forward to pop it in and have a fun time vs. dread a boring workout . thank you hemalayaa , this be wonderful !
Movies_TV	POS	5	with a great mix of action , comedy , style , and of course - conspiracy , enemy of the state be the movie that have it all . with he last `` hip '' style , Will Smith deliver a nonstop thrill ride as he and Gene Hackman fight to bring the government 's spy down on they own turf . if you like Will Smith or Gene Hackman , you 'll love this movie . be thrill and be cautious - they be watch you !!
Movies_TV	POS	4	there really be so many way to tell a story , so many different thing you can emphasize , so many characterization you can change while retain the essence of a story . do Disney make the perfect Peter Pan ? I read this story to my daughter nearly nightly but have never actually see this film . it be be around nearly 60 year as of this writing and I have be alive for many of those year but could not say I take the time to see this Disney ` classic ' . after view it last night I have to say it be ` classic Disney ' - what the Disney company use to be . classical music permeate it which be so different than the mainstream pop\/contempo tune in newer Disney fair . what I really like -lrb- love -rrb- be how innocent the child be . there be no wisecrack , there be honest respect for parent and there be just a certain sweetness that never come across in the newer film . Nemo -lrb- Finding -rrb- perhaps have touch of this innocence characteristic but nothing like sweet little Michael who cling to he teddy bear . another thing I love about this film be the animation . it be beautiful and , again , classic Disney . you can tell a lot of work and care go into every drawing and coloring . even more impressive be the lack of any modern cgus , which may dazzle but usually distract from the story . the only thing I do not enjoy about the film be cultural and a product of they time . the portrayal as woman as these subservient , empty head object be a bit much . the use of classical instrumentation for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER MOVEMENT be barely tolerable . seriously , do a full horn section have to start blare every time Peter Pan lean on a wall ? . there be a few bright musical moment , though -lrb- ` you can fly ' , be pretty enchanting -rrb- . another thing that be really painful to watch be the indian scene ; song like ` what make the redman red ' and the characterization of the chief -lrb- ` how ' ` I set-um you on fire ' ` Squaw no cook , only bring food ' -rrb- cover good ol' 50 's racism and sexism at it be finest . it be weird to think people use to think like that . perhaps such portrayal might have be entertain to little child raise on poorly write western on tv but these day it be the kind of thing that could be edit from the film to positive effect . but for it be flaw I have to say it be still much better than most of what Disney put out , which be remarkable for such a old film -lrb- 1953 -rrb- . definitely worth owning . on a side note , $ 48 to own ... really ? I still can not figure out where Disney get it be fleece , I mean pricing scheme from . be I the only one that think that be a bit steep for a child 's movie ? I have a hard time equate how the company consider itself ` family friendly ' but price it be product -lrb- theme park ticket , dvd 's , etc. -rrb- in range that most middle class family would stretch to afford .
Movies_TV	POS	5	if you do not currently own Peter Pan , and love the movie , you still have time to buy it on video and dvd . but hurry up because Peter Pan and along with beauty and the beast , beauty and the beast the enchanted Christmas and return to Neverland be go out of stock on 1\/31\/03 . along with some other title . whether you believe it or not that Peter Pan 's voice die in 1968 because he have be abuse himself and he body be founde by kid play in a abanded village bulding but I think it take sometime to to discover he be the voice of Peter Pan .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I love Chris E 's doctor . I think , `` no ! they can not take my doctor away from I after only one season ! '' I be distraught . I start to watch the new season with a air of `` how can they ever come back from this , '' and `` sure , the series have to go on ... '' , but then , then I slowly feel in love . David Tenant have a way of look into Billie Piper 's eye and make you feel like this terribly intelligent and easily bore demi-god be completely bind to she , and at the same time , be self-assured and full of life enough to make a complete arse of himself with she . it look like , from they chemistry on the show , that they be have a party every day on the set . and again with the snarky humor . David deliver it spot on . why oh why be there only 12 episode in a year ? what torture wait for the next season .
Movies_TV	POS	5	Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' be one of they most enchantingly delightful animated feature , tell the story of how Peter Pan whisk wendy , John , and Michael off to he home in never land for a magical adventure none of they would ever forget fight Captin Hook and he ruthless band of pirate .  although the original 1999 `` limited issue '' dvd lack bonus feature -lrb- with the only one be the option to watch the movie in french -rrb- , fan of the film have be reward for wait with this special edition . the movie look better then it do on any previous release , and that be reason enough to buy this masterpiece . but the extra feature -- oh ! true , this disc pale in comparison to the platinum edition release of `` Snow White '' -lrb- unfortunately `` Peter Pan '' be NOT one of the nine other platinum edition to be issue over the next decade -rrb- but for one disc I would say they do a pretty nice job . `` you can fly : the make of Peter Pan '' be also provide on the 1998 45th anniversary limited edition VHS , but it be worthy of another watch . after see the movie again , start with that , and then see the wonderful 13-minute 1952 promotional featurette `` the Peter Pan Story . '' they be even more exellent when view together .  Next , head back to the movie , but turn on the audio commentary this time . host by Roy E. Disney , it provide some really amazing information on the film I never know before . other commentator include Walt Disney himself -lrb- piece together from old interview , etc. -rrb- , some of he Nine Old Men , other vetran animator , Kathryn Beaumont -lrb- who provide Wendy 's voice in the feature -rrb- , and of course note film critic Lenoard Multin , among other . next , take a few minute to examine the vast visiual gallery . wonderful stuff in there for fan and casuial viewer alike .  the bonus aim at kid be worth a look too . the best by far be the `` follow the Leader '' sing-along , although it look a bit dull -lrb- not be take from the newly restore version of the film , but a older one -rrb- , and the Pirate Treasure Hunt game be fun , if too easy . the dvd storybook be AWFUL , though , attempt to create a new story out of the animation that be already create for the original movie . if that sound confusing , do not worry , do not bother with the feature . another note : why could not they have put a `` you can fly '' sing along on the disc as well ? there be a Sing along videotape devote to that one as the title tune , so a version do exsist . I ` dve much prefer it over `` follow the Leader , '' but really would have like both . oh well .  lastly , there be a new trailer for `` return to never land '' -lrb- not either of the theatrical one ; this one have some really great new footage -rrb- that be worth a look before you go see the movie . and if you buy this before March 31 , you child will get in free -- as a extra bonus , there be one free child 's admission movie ticket for `` return '' inside every special Edition dvd and video .  in addition to all this , new trailer show that among other `` Beauty and the beast '' and `` the many adventure of Winnie the Pooh '' will make it to dvd this year -lrb- finally -rrb- in October for the former and May for the latter . great news , I think . plus there be a really cute Disney tv spot call `` Magic happen '' on the second menu of trailer .  all in all , this be a wonderful dvd -- much better then the limited issue edition -- and I be glad to own it . something you should not miss ! \*\*\*\*\* -lrb- 5\/5 -rrb-
Movies_TV	POS	4	I remember loving Peter Pan as a child . as a adult I purchase the dvd for my child . the scene with `` follow the Leader , '' and the scene in the nursery be classic Disney . I also have a new respect for how creative the animation be for the time when it be create . I would recommend this Disney film , but as a adult , I notice thing that deter from movie . I still enjoy the movie , but I cringe at the depiction of the female of this film be nothing more than frivolous beauty with nothing to do other than fight over a non-pubescent boy . -lrb- there evidently be not a female writer on staff ! -rrb- I also have trouble with the indian portrayal . I can not decide whether Disney be poke fun at the way Caucasians perceive native Americans , or if the writer be typical of they time period .
Movies_TV	POS	5	a brilliant season that combine outstanding write with charismatic performance . David Tennant and Billie Piper be a incrdible pair of actor surround by a wonderful support cast . the total effect be that you care about the character deeply . keep a full box of tissue on hand for the final episode .
Movies_TV	POS	5	ok , I admit , I do not want to spend the money and start out by borrow this one from the library . in fact , I play it for my almost 3 year old daughter while I take a shower , because I really be not all that interested in a direct to dvd video . she request it again -lrb- and again , and again -rrb- . finally one day i need to get some work do and set up the laptop in the family room while she be watch . needless to say , I do not accomplish much for the duration of the movie . LOL ! what a refreshingly fun story ! I love that Cinderella take charge of she own destiny instead of be `` save by the handsome prince '' . I also like the character development of Anastasia - although I find it a little difficult to swallow the thought of she as a sympathetic character , it do work very well . you see the progression of change , so it make sense . not a big fan of the `` I know I be in love the moment I touch she hand '' thing , but it be still a fairy tale , after all . the animation of the face be even better than the original . Cinderella 's expression be gorgeous and tug at you heart . the voice be wonderful , too . and very true to the original .
Movies_TV	POS	5	there be many many movie that use the image of PETER PAN , but the DISNEY animation be by far the best one !!!! WOW ! this movie be great ... like most of the DISNEY animation , i recommend this classic to everyone !!!!
Movies_TV	POS	5	very enjoyable , even for a minor fan . David Tennant be a wonderful replacement for Christopher Eccleston .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I know alot of people hate the `` sequel '' Disney movie simply because they feel they creation `` desecrate '' the memory of the original . ah but do remember , these be never `` original '' Disney property to begin with , they be softer retelling of fairy tale or other classic novel . Cinderella III be a entertaining movie . it be animation be quite fluid , with a few mistake here and there , it be still a bright , vibrant movie with consistent character design . the storyline be a `` alternative '' storyboard , where the character be force back in time and down different path for the sake of the storyboard . this make thing interesting , and even the comedic bit be either slapstick , or subtle intelligent and amusing . the bottom line be that this be one of the best thing Disney have release in recent year ... they non-pixar cg movie have be terrible -lrb- `` Chicken Little '' almost unwatchable it be so bad -rrb- and not much else have come from the studio . anyone that love fairy tale , Cinderella , alternate timeline -lrb- a popular device in Sci Fi and fantasy -rrb- etc will enjoy this movie . my daughter be three and this be by far she favorite film right now -lrb- yes , even over `` classic '' like `` Cinderella one '' as she call it , etc -rrb- .

I be pretty sure that I be one of the only people who honestly do not think about racial issue at all when watch movie like this . my aunt be full-blooded Cherokee Indian and she love this movie . I guess I just do not think about thing the way many other do . I do not want to get into a discussion of all this p.c. propoganda . all I be say be , this movie be definitely a classic , and should be a part of any kid 's life .
Movies_TV	POS	4	Series one be a tacky , self-mocking soap opera set on Earth with lot of trademark from `` Doctor who '' insert just so the series title could be validate . but while series 1 have its problem , it do have a few worthy moment too . so , how do series 2 compare ? Series two do feel more like ` traditional , classic who ' , especially compare to series 1 . there be a few issue -lrb- just about all of it be earth-based again -rrb- , but all and all it be definitely a tremendous improvement . David Tennant be a refreshing change from the do-nothing Christopher Eccleston . from the wacky to the serious , and from be pro-active and right down to the costume , improvement be all over the place . the overall quality of series two 's episode be definitely sporadic . Series 1 have a similar feel with all of its story , even if the story themselves be lacklustre at best . season two go all over the place in tone and intellectual quality , and despite its clunker be definitely worth the different format -lrb- and actor ! -rrb- indeed , the fact Tennant argue for the character 's name in the end credit to be rename to `` the doctor '' be inspiring . rate on a 4 star basis , 4 be best and 0 be worst : the CHRISTMAS INVASION \* \* 1\/2 the new doctor spend most of the episode in a coma , leave Rose and Mickey to figure out what be up with a bunch of mysterious and deadly Christmas figure and decoration . the only saving grace here be Tennant 's performance , and he be keep to the side for most of it . still , he presence give we hope ... NEW EARTH 1\/2 think we 'll finally get a story set on another planet ? not quite . the replacement for Earth be still call Earth . the whole thing feel like a throwback to Eccleston 's era , right down to body function joke and sexual innuendo -- mindless fluff that be not `` Doctor who '' . this one nearly have I call it quit ... glad I keep on . tooth and claw \* \* \* 1\/2 Queen Victoria , werewolf , odd karate monk ... everything about this be rather good . but something call a Torchwood ? Hmmm ... SCHOOL REUNION \* \* \* anthony Stuart Head steal the show as the villain . it also add some new depth into Mickey . it also bring back Sarah Jane and K9 . my problem with this one be , Sarah Jane be make out to be a ex-lover of the doctor . -lrb- even Mickey state a obvious comment and we be grateful it be not the doctor who say it . -rrb- it be get a lot of great moment -lrb- and in way be what `` Logopolis '' should have be -rrb- , but the bad moment -lrb- involve the verbal sparring between Sarah Jane and Rose -rrb- be cringe . still , all thing consider , it be worth 3 out of 4 . the girl in the fireplace \* \* \* 1\/2 another winner , yet with another drunken excuse to thrust in more sexuality . this time , it be the Doctor himself go after a lady . everything else about this story be great ... then consider the writer of it write the british comedy `` coupling '' and it all make sense as to why the Doctor have to have a sex life . sigh ... why ??? why continue to humanize a alien character for pointless rating ? on the flip side , the ship itself be a inverse of a Cyberman : human organ operate a machine mind . that be way-cool . but the sexual flippancy that be prevalent in the new series in general , why why why ? rise of the CYBERMEN \* \* \* a interesting twist on the re-invention of the Cybermen : a parallel dimension . -lrb- could this parallel Earth be Mondas , the Cybermens ' home world in we universe ? -rrb- we also get the big revelation the TARDIS be organic . -lrb- that be great if the idea of organic technology have not be develop by any number of sci-fi author in the past , include `` Doctor who '' back in 1971 with `` the Claws of Axos '' ! -rrb- the cliffhanger be decent too ... but this one be actually decent . the age of STEEL \* \* 1\/2 Mickey be still great . unfortunately , that be about it . the sonic screwdriver , which have be misuse and overuse in the past , be really OTT in this episode as , amongst other thing , it distract a whole regimen of Cybermen . we also do not need the 59th reminder this be not `` we '' Earth therefore it be not `` we '' Jackie and Pete . the cliffhanger resolution be paltry ... there be some redeeming scene , such as get to empathize with a convert human ... but it be not a perfect resolution . and parallel technology seem quite compatible despite they universe be much more advanced . still , if you do not think about plot hole , change motive , or bad idea in general , this story -lrb- along with most of they -rrb- would all be 4 out of 4 star . also , the new Cybermen costume be not all that great either . sci-fi fan will recognize it as a amalgamation of c3po -lrb- star war -rrb- with melkur -lrb- from the Doctor who story ` the keeper of traken ' -rrb- the idiot 's LANTERN \* \* \* not the best explain , but definitely a creepy and interesting idea regard technology consuming people ' life . -lrb- there be two theme in this series : 1 be Torchwood , which seem force at time . the 2nd be the integration of technology into people ' life , usually for bad effect . this 2nd one be far more interesting and worthy , and the metaphor use in ` the idiot 's Lantern ' be quite good indeed ... -rrb- the impossible planet \* \* \* 1\/2 hmmm . should be a classic . but why be not it ? the fear factor be there , many moment that could have end up as hokey joke be play straight ... but there be no depth to the plot . not even little hint of intellectual depth . nothing to think about , it be just be spoon out to viewer . but it be tense , gripping , and worthy ... but it be a tease . the first time we be away from Earth and there be no alien civilization . just more bogeymonster . the SATAN PIT \* \* \* 1\/2 premonition and resolution . indeed , this conclusion to `` the impossible planet '' be very good indeed , and while the beast be too synonymous with a particular religion , it be venerable . love & MONSTERS ___ why ? it be a parody of who fan , but at least it be parody the new series rather than the classic one . some bit do work , but other be awful . I like the idea of the monster , but they have to go overboard with the crass crudeness and bodily function joke , of which series 2 have be mostly devoid of -- up until now . oh well , I should not have have high hope . -lrb- the writer must be a fan of fox cartoon show ... -rrb- I will not bother to mention the final gag scene at the end . all I 'll say be `` there be a literal meaning to that '' . it redefine low . fear her \* \* \* Hmmm . it seem to be a knock-off of a potential `` Sapphire and Steel '' story . -lrb- or for Americans , it be rather like a episode of `` the X-Files '' . -rrb- the trouble be , the story lose its way at the 35 minute mark and never recover . as usual , the more interesting point be not explain . it be a real mixed bag , but the good point -lrb- e.g. the doctor be trap -rrb- make up for it . the lead-in to the next story be also great at the time . army of ghost \* \* \* \* no more silly reference , Torchwood be reveal . smooth . not quite the same theme as `` bad Wolf '' -lrb- for `` bad Wolf '' , Rose create it but the circumstance be implausible -rrb- , but it be not as loosely shrug off either -lrb- we have no idea how Torchwood would be define ... or how it could exist without UNIT know about it , but that be fair too -rrb- . this be Russell t Davies ' best who story of they all . it be taut , gripping , have some intelligence behind it -lrb- though I be hope it would be more than parallel universe cyberman wander into ours -rrb- , and then there be that cliffhanger that nobody expect -- the return of Daleks . doomsday \* okay , let 's turn the whole affair into a parody of a self-mockery . apart from the initial Dalek\/Cybermen spat , there be nothing worthy here . even rtd can not decide if the Genesis Ark be Dalek or Time Lord technology and merrily mix it up as he go along . worse , have be tell 5,000 time that he be not we Pete and not we Jackie , the doctor seem intent on get Rose to stay with they . and for all the maudlin drivel over Rose say she be die , she be also suggest she be not alive until she meet the doctor . this mean she be only 2 . Hmmm , sound about right ... Billie Piper be a great actress , but Rose be always a huge annoyance when not be a bland one . -rrb- so much plot potential be throw out by empty excuse , and for the big build-up of Rose 's death of fight a big foe , this be one real cheat . and it be a real shame ; I be expect so much more from a terrific build-up . I be look forward to series 3 . all in all , the improvement far outweight the silly quibble that the production team and writer can not seem to wholly divorce themselves from , but series 2 be a massive improvement .

Movies_TV	POS	4	this movie be worth watch ... i admit that the acting be not the greatest and that the movie be not much more than a hollywood glam flick , but what save it -lrb- for I -rrb- be the character gene hackman play ... it be all about brill -lrb- gene hackman -rrb- if you ask I ... what this movie do be bring back the surveillance expert harry caul -lrb- gene hackman -rrb- from francis ford coppolum 's masterpiece , the conversation ... that be a truly wonderful movie and the character be memorable enough that he revival in this movie make it a must see -lrb- and if you do not see the conversation , that be a definite must see -rrb- ... the espionage king , harry caul , who be a master at wire tap in the 70s be back in the modern age , as a hacker , to help out will smith who be in a real jam ... i know i have talk a bit much about the conversation -lrb- only because you should see it if you see or have see this movie -rrb- so i 'll say that enemy of the state get to suspense level comparable to the fugitive -lrb- with harrison ford -rrb- and feed off of -lrb- you guess it -rrb- the conversation ...

'' and you hear the ticking of the crocodile . I do not know why that be so funny to I . anyway , this be a cool movie , and if you have not see it you definitely should rent it . : -rrb-  P.S. what be the deal with Peter Pan 's voice in the sequel ? it be totally weird !!!

Hopefully Pinnochio will be come soon to platinum . I have the limited edition and it be a pretty bad transfer -lrb- look like straight from VHS with no clean up -rrb- . however , im holding on to it incase they censor the platinum version . I think this re-release of PeterPan be a signal that Disney be see the light . they be lose alot of revenue to chinese bootleg be sell on -lrb- ... -rrb- , and god know -lrb- ... -rrb- doesnt give a crap about enforcement .

I have always have a fascination with this story . as a kid I remember check the Disney picture book version out of the library week after week . when I finally get to see it , I be enthral . there be just something magical about the story . it be partially the come together of all the boyhood adventure in one place . Mermaids , Indians , and Pirates ? what more could any boy want ? and , of course , the ability to fly . the `` you can fly '' sequence over London be one of my all time favorite . the whole movie really be animated very well with a story that movie quickly from place to place with lot of humor to keep everyone entertain and gorgeous animation of the fanciful never land . this special edition be worth track down . the picture -lrb- original full frame -rrb- be sharp and the surround sound be very nice . extra include a documentary on the making of the movie and a promotional theatrical featurette from the original release . the `` audio commentary '' be unique . host by Roy Disney , it consist of selection from interview of the voice talent , live action model , animator , and animation historian . while not you usual commentary , it be fascinating stuff and well worth a listen . finally , there be a treasure hunt game and dvd storybook for kid . this movie still bring a smile to my face and probably always will . maybe my friend be right when they say I love this movie so much because I always want to be Peter Pan .

Movies_TV	POS	5	all in all a pretty good effort from David Tennant and Billie Piper . the season get off with a mediocre effort , New Earth . Kind of annoy how the doctor treat the cat nurse after all they have do to cure humanity of disease . they have to create guinea pig to experiment they procedure on . I think I would not like this doctor at all . but then a funny thing happen on the way to the finale . the story keep get better and better ! -lrb- up to a point , which you will see . -rrb- School Reunion be just that , bring back two old favorite . after see School Reunion , you will never look at Sarah Jane Smith 's story with Tom Baker 's Doctor the same again . the impossible Planet\/Satan pit sequel be perhaps the strongest effort , contain aspect of the Omen and Alien . then come a slight drop-off in story quality . love and monster can claim to be the strangest , most unusual Doctor who story ever see , not good , but a decent story . follow the Satan pit do not help it in term of excitement . fear she be a pretty weak story with a couple nice moment , such as the doctor light the Olympic torch at the end . just when I think the season hit the skid , along come the tremendous finale , Army of Ghosts\/Doomsday . believe I , this story be fantastic and leave a lasting effect on the viewer . you can feel the Doctor 's sadness at apparently lose Rose forever . it be also nice to see Mickey back again , not the same cowardly Mickey whom the doctor refer to as Mickey the idiot , but a brave freedom-fighting Mickey . do not let a couple weak story spoil the whole season . this be a season that build towards a exciting and heart-wrenching climax .

Movies_TV	POS	4	the tale of Cinderella , with she kind beauty and rags-to-riches storybook end , will stand the test of time as one of the most beloved child 's story . while Disney 's attempt at `` Cinderella II '' be a nightmare , the new story put forth in `` Cinderella III : A twist in Time '' be much more imaginative and satisfy for all . quick Synopsis : Cinderella have be marry to she Prince Charming for almost a year , and have never be happier . unfortunately , she evil step-mother and horrible step-sister be not so lucky . after Anastasia accidentally get ahold of the Fairy Godmother 's magic wand , Cinderella 's step-mother use it to turn back time and change the outcome of the tale ! instead of Cinderella 's foot fitting the glass slipper , it be Anastasia who squeeze on the slipper and steal the Prince ! luckily , Cinderella have she trusty animal friend to help she set thing right ... but she wicked step-mother be not go to make it easy ... this direct to dvd movie do a good job at create a imaginative new story with such beloved character . it even have beautiful new song , and plenty of twist and turn in the plot . just when you think everything be as it should be , and the story be about to get it be happy end , Disney throw another wrench in the mix and keep on go . while it be probably a good thing it go straight to dvd -lrb- it be not quite good enough for theater -rrb- , I think disney-lover will still find it a enjoyable film for the whole family . there be a few fun special feature available on the disc as well , include a interactive game wherein the viewer go on a miniature scavenger hunt around the castle and try to fix magical blunder create by that cranky cat , Lucifer , and those mischievious mouse . there be also a cd-rom for you home computer ! these be mostly special feature to entertain the child , but as Disney be always remind we , you do not have to be a child to be young at heart . bottom line , it be a fun new story , and it be worth the addition to any Disney library .

Movies_TV	POS	4	of all the Disney adaptated tale , Peter Pan be proably one of the best . while not as dark as jm Barrie 's original story , it keep the spirit of the original work and make it family friendly without betray it -lrb- Hercules anyone ? talk about completly gut the source material -rrb- . this be a acceptable adaptation in comparrison to Hercules .  Peter 's arrogance and pretty much be oblivious to the way the girl around he feel about he be right on point . Tink , Wendy , and even Tiger Lily all want Peter to be something he can never be , a man . while he willingness to sacrafice for the good of other and be a knight in shin armor of sort must be what draw the girl in , but on a personal level he can never connect in a mature way . even when he start out on a nobel effort -lrb- like save Tiger Lily -rrb- he get so catch up in the game he just about forget that he be there to save the young lady . this be certainly a impression of Peter give in the book . you can not really hate he for he moment of be a silly boy , especially when it come to girl , because that be all he be and all he can ever be , a boy . and as for the ` jealouse woman ' reaction that circle the film , it be important to note they be not woman -- they be girl . yes , Tink be a fairy but she sense of thing seem to be at the same level as wendy .  some of the complaint I have hear about the film be the way the Indians be portray . and quite a few line -lrb- ` ugh ' , ` how ' , the ` red man ' song -rrb- be proably a unfortunate product of the time . but the fact be , when I be a kid I do run around say ` bwah , bwah , bwah ' when I play ` indian ' . so it make sense in a world lock into a child 's sense of the world the indian -lrb- to proper english child -rrb- would be a bit exagurated .  so all in all , Disney do a pretty good job adapt this into a film . and it be still a favorite . all in all it be a good peice .

Movies_TV	POS	5	I love this movie , as I do all the earlier Disney animation . I read the review by Carolinapooh , and I , too , remember that the part about clap to keep Tinkerbell alive be in the movie ! if you watch it , you will see Tinkerbell fading , and then there be a abrupt cut and suddenly she be ok . why would they have take it out ? maybe they think kid today be just too sophisticated for that , and sadly , they may be right .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I be go to be honest with you . when this movie be release and I see the trailer , I do not want to see it .  maybe it be because I think it be a team of Will Smith and Gene Hackman and I could not imagine the chemistry for the two as actor but I do not watch it .  after watch it , here be a few word and sentence that describe my feeling of this movie :  simply awesome !  as you can see , I really enjoy this movie . it be very good ! from start to beginning , you attention will be focus on this movie ! Tech people and those who wonder about privacy issue will definitely love this movie . it be all good ! & # 63728 ; Will Smith be truly wonderful in this film . the ending be very well do . Gene Hackman do a wonderful job as well . the chemistry as actor between the two work well . it be also nice to see Lisa Bonet in this film .

John Voight play a very well do evil political figure .  the video of this film be very good . the audio be very good as well ! it be one of the thing that keep my attention be the sound and to hear my subwoofer go boom quite frequently !  as for the extra 's , you get a few of they . it be pretty cool to see the featurette , the trailer and trailer for other movie . the only thing be the featurette be too short and for a movie this big ... there have to be delete scene right ? anyway , I wish they include the delete scene and much more to the extra 's but nevertheless , they do include really cool featurette .  again , this movie be brilliant ! so , you read the review ... buy it ! highly recommend !
Movies_TV	POS	5	I rent this film so my husband and I could go on a date and leave a new film with the babysitter . I actually start watch it while I get ready ! my baby love it and I have to re-rent it twice as it be no longer available on shelf . while this be not to be compare to the `` move art '' of the 40 's and 50 's Disney film it be a fantastic story ! Cinderella be a sweet , kind , caring and graceful girl who get to live a happily ever after life thanks to she friend the mouse and she fairy Godmother . but what if the magic that propel Cinderella to `` Princess '' be in the wrong hand ? Cinderella 's fairy tale be rewind and rewrite leave we heroine to fend for herself . I be impressed that Cinderella maintain she sweet and happy demeanor even while take responsibility for she future . in today 's world it be refresh when a girl can maintain grace , dignity , and class while still reach for and obtain she dream . some of the song that Cinderella sing be very pretty and they do well in find a voice talent that would come close to the original actress both in demeanor and pitch . a few of the song can get kind of cheesy and the mouse have a bit of a tendency to really annoy you but I promise you 'll be watch you baby act out to and laugh at these moment . this movie be gear towards young child with enough of a plot to stand on its own and to be enjoy by all age . the animation be brighter than in the original but try to maintain `` the look '' of Cinderella and she fellow cast . the moral of the story be that if you believe in Love and in yourself you can do anything , even without Disney 's signature dose of magic . I would recommend this product to anyone look to revisit the world of Cinderella . you will not leave disappointed this time .

Movies_TV	POS	4	what I like about Will Smith in this movie be that he can show he can play a serious actor without resort to he fresh Prince character again and again . case in point : Independence Day and Men in Black . both good movie , but not much of a stretch for Smith . here , he be quite darned good as a dc labor laywer set up by a agency of the government , head by Jon Voight . it turn out Smith be carry a piece of evidence that will expose Voight as the murderer of a famous congressman .  will Smith 's life be throw in disarray ; he wife think he be cheat on she with he ex-girlfriend , he be be fire , and now he only hope be a recluse play by Gene Hackman . together only can they clear Smith 's name and bring down Voight 's character . the action scene be quite good , and the sound from this dvd will blow you sock off during the explosion . the best part though be about basic privacy . there be satellite look down on we all the time , how the government can hack we computer and listen in we phone call in the name of national security . some very serious question be raise in this enjoyable action thriller .

I watch peter pan for the first time when i be five `` Peter Pan '' be a great classic film . when I be a kid , I use to watch it all the time and i still do , mainly because I use to wish that I would never grow up , just like Peter Pan and the lose boy . now that I be grow , I do not have those thought any more , but I still enjoy watch `` Peter Pan .

I be get ahead of myself here ! for those of we of a `` certain age , '' as we say in England - that be the wrong side of 40 ! LOL ! - and remember the origin of the series waaaaaaaaay back in the 60 's , then spend the subsequent decade suffer through more cardboard set and rubber monster than you could shake a stick at - the Daleks be honorable exception of course ! - the rebirth of the venerable doctor in 2005 be a revelation . the story have be tightened-up considerably - no run up and down endless corridor filler here ! - the budget for a single episode appear to be more than be spend on a entire series from the good-old-day , the production values\/sfx be stellar , the write tight and dramatic , bring the doctor and he companion thoroughly up-to-date without lose the essence of the original . in Chris Eccleston they have , at last , a genuine , heavyweight thesp play the doctor , a actor who could not only handle the edgier , more grown-up aspect of the new story , but could also inject a element of the manic\/slightly unhinge into he performance , similar to the much-loved Tom Baker . and any worry that Billie Piper would not be up to the job , dramatically , be soon lay to rest ... and how !!! to say that we fan be spoil by the 2005 series be put it mildly , then as the season climax with the superlative `` bad Wolf '' and `` parting of the Ways , '' we be all throw for a loop when give a `` regeneration scene '' and a new doctor ! what be the BBC think about , be they crazy ?!?!?! the short answer be `` no , '' the casting of David Tennant be every bit as inspire as he predecessor ; he actually manage to up the manic-quotient without go completely bonkers , and bring a kind of geeky coolness to the character we have not see before ! and then there be `` Rose ; '' oh my goodness , in all it be year , there have never be a companion for the Doctor like Rose Tyler . unlike practically all previous companion , Rose be a character in she own right , with she own back story , fully realize , she be , dramatically at least , the Doctor 's equal . she development , from London shop-girl , to time traveler , explorer of the universe , and killer of Daleks , help drive the story in a new , more emotionally fulfil direction . after the roller coaster ride of season 1 with it be `` bad Wolf '' story arc , season 2 scale thing back ever so slightly , but invest even more time and effort in explore the relationship between the unearthly doctor , and the all-too-human Rose . this be tackle head-on in the 4th episode , `` School Reunion , '' which go some way to answer the question of what happen to the companion after they have stop travel with the Time Lord ; a stand-out episode , it re-introduce Elizabeth Sladen 's `` Sarah Jane Smith . '' I do not want to say too much about any particular episode for those who have not see the series yet , but the scene where Sarah Jane discover the TARDIS and its owner make the hair on the back of my neck stand up ! later in the episode there be a affect scene between the doctor and Rose as he try to explain to she why he can not allow himself to become emotionally involve with he human companion ... he be practically immortal , we be not . the next episode , `` the girl in the fireplace , '' perfectly illustrate the precede point , when the doctor allow himself to become attach to Madame de Pompadour , whilst simultaneously battle clockwork android on a derelict starship in the far future ! `` rise of the Cybermen '' and `` Age of Steel '' successfully reinvent one of the doctor most popular adversary , whilst `` the impossible planet '' and `` the Satan pit '' set-up some very alien-esque chill in a wonderful two-parter . the series end , just as do season 1 , with another amazing two-part story , `` Army of Ghosts '' and the aptly title `` Doomsday , '' which see the Daleks fight it out with the new-and-improved Cybermen for control of planet earth ; to steal a line from the totally execrable avp , `` whoever win , we lose ! '' LOL ! it be difficult to know which fate would be worse , have the whole planet `` upgrade '' by the Cybermen , or flay and fillet through the Daleks genetic lab to help create a even bigger and more murderous Dalek army !!! this be a superb story to end the season , but be warn , the finale be ... emotional ! there be a nice recur theme in the series concern the `` Torchwood Institute , '' which become central to the final two episode , and if this set be the first you have see of season 2 , DO make sure you watch the `` Children in Need '' episode in the `` special feature '' section of the set FIRST . it act as a coda to season 1 , as well as a prologue to season 2 , and explain the somewhat crazed materialization of the TARDIS , as well as the Doctor himself , in the rollick first episode , `` the Christmas Invasion .

Movies_TV	POS	4	it be easier to judge Walt Disney 's 1953 animated adaptation of James Barrie 's `` Peter Pan '' for what it be ; rather than for what it be not . what the film get right , it get spectacularly right . animation be , indeed , the best medium to capture the magical aspect of the story . the sequence where Peter Pan , Wendy , John , and Michael fly from London to Never-Land be stunning . it be almost immediately apparent why `` Peter Pan '' be one of the finest Disney film of the 1950 's . the film gain much of its appeal from the excellent vocal performance of Bobby Driscoll -lrb- Peter Pan -rrb- , Hans Conreid -lrb- Mr. Darling and Captain Hook -rrb- , Kathryn Beaumount , -lrb- Wendy -rrb- and Bill Thompson -lrb- Mr. Smee -rrb- . the story have plenty of action and adventure , and move along at a brisk pace . the depiction of the Indians as caricature instead of character be painfully , politically incorrect . but one must remember the era in which this film be make . it would be decade before Cathy Rigby 's stage revival of `` Peter Pan '' would correct this sticky situation . but , as the stage and animated film be completely different medium , the point be moot . the Disney version of `` Peter Pan '' be a artistic triumph . it be often delightful , but it be only about fun and game in Never-Land . while Disney capture the magic and fantasy brilliantly , he never grasp the darker , psychologically complex aspect of the story . the Disney version capture Peter Pan as the spirit of youth , joy , and freedom , but lack the emotional depth of Barrie 's original story . the great villain Captain Hook clearly represent the `` adult , father figure '' who must be destroy because he be a threat to all the fun and game . there be no romantic tension between Peter Pan and Wendy . there be no acknowledgement of Peter 's lonliness or the thing he will never have . at the end of Barrie 's play , Peter Pan return to the nursery and discover wendy be now a grown-up adult . Disney completely ignore Barrie 's end , and all of its bittersweet implication . the dvd feature a excellent audio commentary by the late Roy Disney , -lrb- Walt 's nephew -rrb- , film critic Leonard Maltin , several of the animator , Margaret Kerry -lrb- the model for the hot-tempered , jealous pixie Tinker Bell -rrb- , Kathryn Beaumount -- and even some surprising comment from Walt Disney himself . the short featurette `` the make of Peter Pan '' and the longer documentary `` the Peter Pan that almost be '' , be especially informative and entertaining . the brief life of Bobby Driscoll , more tragic than magic , be a sad footnote to `` Peter Pan . '' Driscoll , who receive a special academy award for he role in the suspense-thriller `` the window '' , make immeasurable contribution to the success of Disney 's `` song of the South '' , `` so Dear to my Heart '' , `` Treasure Island '' and `` Peter Pan . '' after he Disney contract be drop -lrb- the same month , incidentally , that `` Peter Pan '' be release -rrb- , Driscoll descend into drug addiction and spend some time in prison . Driscoll die in 1968 , alone and peniless , at the age of 31 . of he movie career , Driscoll remark , `` I be carry on a satin pillow ... and then dump into the garbage . '' magic and happiness , it often seem , exist only in the movie .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this movie be horrible and ruin how magnificent the first original one be , it might be great for little kid to watch but Disney make sequel after sequel and they just keep make all of the original look so bad . this movie try to be comedic and it be not , it be stupid funny . Anastasia meet a guy in the 2nd one but in the third she talk about never find true love and try to steal away the prince until the end , the stepmother be not wear the same color dress when they flash back , the voice be not even close to the original , except for the stepmother , the fairy godmother some how manage to stay frozen even when they go back into time , it just do not make any sense on how they make this movie . Walt Disney would be roll over in he grave with how many poorly make sequel Disney have do , it make Disney look like they be be desperate to make money when clearly they be wealthy enough !! do not buy this movie rent it and burn it , it be not as much money to WASTE !!!

'' plus , the reference to they as `` red man '' would make many people cringe today .  a earlier reviewer mention that he daughter do not like Peter Pan . that do not surprise I . woman be paint with broad stereotype in this movie , from jealousy and fickleness , to be helpless . this be a movie that will definitely appeal to boy , but may leave the little girl longing for mulan or the little mermaid . parent may want to consider this .  in spite of these shortcoming , this dvd have launch itself to the top of we play list at home , along with Iron Giant and Titan AE .

I could not believe this . personally I be shock they find a actor this good to play Doctor who . now they get rid of he and replace he with a new actor . my thought , the show be over , they will never find another person to play the doctor as well as this first guy . to my amazement this new guy be unbelieveable as the doctor . he be even better then the first and remind I a lot of Tom Baker . the second season be great all the way through until the end .

David Tennant -lrb- regenerate 10th doctor -rrb- and Billie Piper -lrb- companion - Rose Tyler from the last doctor -rrb- start we with the Christmas invasion with the colorful cast of Jackie and Mickey who be Rose 's mum and pal\/pseudo-boyfriend . Tennant quickly develop he similar style in loud and snide comment as eccelston do last year . however , he add another side of humor which be more physical and serious than Eccelston . Piper be pretty much herself and the mother character be more hilarious and kookier than Rose 's sweet nature .

Gene Hackman enter the scene as the shadowy Brill running , and he never stop . Brill be essentially paranoia incarnate - though by the time we have meet he , we know enough about the Government 's surveillance method to empathize with he fear . Jon Voight play the latest in a long line of heavy -lrb- he be the evil lawyer in `` Rainmaker '' -rrb- but otherwise never connect as a villain . but the real star of the flick be the direction , which be fast and coherent at the same time . otherwise , the flick pay lip service to Hollywood 's need for a apparent message -lrb- beware nig government 's intrusion on you privacy -rrb- without make the movie deep enough for you to care .

Director Tony Scott brilliantly use the camera to portray he view , jolt the character through a series of incredible chase scene , rip-roaring explosion , and intense firearm combat , but ultimately `` enemy of the state '' focus solely on the unbridled advance in special effect ability that it keep the audience from understand the story and get involve with the character . Smith be only adequate in he first major `` dramatic '' role , while Hackman and Voight pick up some of the slack in they devilishly effective part . a must-see if you be into big explosion and dynamite cinematography , but one to leave on the shelf if over-acting and a mediocre script be a annoyance .
Movies_TV	POS	5	one of the thing that be hard for a show to do , even a long-running series , be to match the success and strong story element of the first season the second time around . but the cast and crew of `` Doctor who '' not only match the success of season one , but actually surpass it with the second season . David Tennant , take the TARDIS key from Christopher Eccleston , prove to be a fantastic successor to the role of the Doctor , bring a lot of humor and gravitas to the role , and be support by the equally-fantastic Billie Piper as he companion , Rose Tyler . couple with a brilliant support cast , strong storytelling , fantastic visual and strong music , this be a terrific season of the show . highlight include : `` the Christmas Invasion , '' David Tennant 's premiere episode ; `` Tooth and Claw , '' which bring werewolf into a story of alien after Queen Victoria ; `` School Reunion , '' which reunite the doctor with Sarah Jane Smith and k-9 ; `` the Girl in the Fireplace , '' a brilliant episode from the always-brilliant Steven Moffat ; the two-part `` the impossible Planet\/The Satan pit , '' which pit the doctor against the Devil himself ; and the two-part finale , `` Army of Ghosts\/Doomsday , '' which feature both a head-to-head battle between the Daleks and the Cybermen , and the exit of Rose as a companion in a final scene that will leave nobody with a dry eye . the dvd release of series two be also improve over the first . the picture quality be fantastic , and the audio , a problem with the previous set , be much improve . extra be fantastic , from David Tennant 's video diary to cut-down version of `` Doctor who Confidential . '' longtime fan and newcomer to the show will definitely want this set in they collection ! allons-y ! Program\/DVD Grade : a +
Movies_TV	NEG	1	I would buy this , if the dvd price be not so insane . $ 20 - $ 30 for a season be fine . I like support creative artist whose work I enjoy . that be say , I watch this elsewhere on the internet . it be good .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I do not remember ever be that take with Peter Pan when I be younger , it certainly be never my favorite , but as I have mention in previous review , I be collect the special edition , and wait -lrb- im -rrb- patiently for the one that have already be out , and go again . convenient how they be release these special edition around every 6 year or so , just in time for the next generation to start clamour at they parent that they want they ! while I find Peter Pan funnier than I remember -lrb- Mr Darling , Smee , Captain Hook & the croc -rrb- , I could not help but see Bob Hoskins as Smee and Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook - yes I have see Hook way too many time ! apart from that , I notice that , although not as much as the earlier Disney movie , there be still some reference that I really do not think should be in a kid movie - the fairy dust for instance ? that make they fly ? how many of you try to jump off you garden fence or you garage when you be young ? and also the fact they show John smoking what look like very suspicious substance . but this certainly would not be show in today 's very politically correct Disney . there be also some terrible stereotype about american Indians . I find Wendy 's voice as irritating as usual , but I definitely find it familiar , so I be probably still remember it from when I be young . Peter be never a favorite character of mine and like Walt Disney himself , I find it to be really cold and quite unlikable . this be a must for collector , with the usual special feature , although if you find yourself bore during the game , that be because they be aim at kid . not we old one . unless you fancy try the 9x9 suduko - I could not do it . the next special edition be the jungle book , out in the autumn , not particularly another favorite of mine , but I be still look forward to it .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	we buy this video with a condition rating of NEW ! the video be certainly not new , the case be dirty - the movie be all static , and it skip . my son -lrb- who be autistic -rrb- have a extreme melt down because he be suppose to be able to watch PETER PAN , and we could not get through the movie !

Movies_TV	NEU	3	I be not a proponent of Disney milk the cash cow of they classic animated film by produce far inferior sequel . about half of the film in the Disney animated library now have direct to dvd sequel . however , the quality of the recent rush of Disney animated sequel have be much better than the sequel predecessor -lrb- BAMBI II for instance be not too bad of a direct dvd release -rrb- . maybe the folk at the Giant Mouse House have receive enough complaint that they be try to make decent sequel . CINDERELLA III : A TWIST in TIME be nowhere near as good a film as the original Disney CINDERELLA . however , the film be not too bad of a movie , especially for a direct-to-dvd release . it look more like a wonderful world of Disney episode or a Friday evening special instead of a Saturday morning hack-job cartoon that many direct-to-dvd cartoon look like . the movie begin on the one-year marriage anniversary of Cinderella and Prince Charming . Cinderella 's Fairy Godmother seem to become more absent-minded and throw she magic wand into the air and loose it . it land in front of a hidden Anastasia who have just learn that Cinderella have magic in help she win Charming 's hand . she rush back to tell she mother the news . the evil stepmother use the wand to turn Fairy Godmother into a statue , turn back time to prevent Cinderella from marry charming , and cast a spell on charming so he fall in love with Anastasia . Cinderella and she mouse friend , Gus and Jaq , know something be out of place , but they do not know what . but they do not give up and be determine to break charming out of he spell . after all , in a fairy tale love conquer all . CINDERELLA III be clearly a movie make for young child , especially very young girl . very young boy -lrb- three or younger -rrb- might enjoy the movie , but the film 's overall message and focus be on young girl . other than a few visual allusion here and there to classic swashbuckling movie , there really be not anything to interest parent , either . the style of animation be a interesting merge between the classic-style of the original CINDERELLA and more colorful and contemporary cartoon . with that say , the movie could have be much worst . when I first hear about the plot of the film , I think it be fitting because Disney often act like the evil stepmother try to turn back time to make more money and change and legacy and history of some of they most cherish creation . however , in watch CINDERELLA III I be begin to wonder if Disney be more like Anastasia and be learn the error of its way . in watch the movie , be sure to watch through the credit as various painting answer some question the story leave open and halfway through there be a coda to the film 's event . the dvd do not include many special feature . there be a music video with Hayden Panettiere -lrb- who voice Kairi in the Kingdom Hearts game and play Claire Bennet on hero -rrb- , a behind the scene look at the Disney Cruise show , `` twice charm '' which inspire CINDERELLA III , Bibbidi-Bobbidi Game , and a interactive activity call Cinderella 's ballroom that only work use a dvd-rom on a computer .

I lose count of how many time the word `` kill '' come up in this movie . no surprise that now my 3 year old be go around say `` I be go to kill you '' to anyone . this be a outrage and I wonder why English speak kid deserve to be protect from this kind of language , and spanish speaking kid do not . this be a terrible , terrible mistake . Disney be a company for kid everywhere in the world , no matter what language they speak .

I find this taut thriller even more suspenseful the second time around ; moreover , it have assume a chilling plausibility -- probably because of now be able to ` tour ' various world capital at street level on Google map . Will Smith and Gene Hackman -lrb- and he cat -rrb- have a marvelous on-camera chemistry ; and whereas some of the ` hot political thriller ' that I have see of late fall flat or run out of steam at the end , `` enemy of the state '' pack a wallop that really deliver !
Movies_TV	POS	5	one of the best Disney film ever consider both story & song , and for its remarkable animation , Peter Pan be the story of the boy who would not grow up .

Movies_TV	POS	4	when I first hear about Cinderella 3 , I be really excited and could not wait to see it . the title be pretty catchy . the first week when I find out , I coud not talk or think about anything else .

I think it be really funny . when I watch it , I be laugh so hard I have tear in my eye . Gus and Jack be really funny to . do not miss this film !!!!
Movies_TV	NEG	2	I love Disney movie and I remember loving this movie as a kid , but OMG the portrayal of native Americans be so blatantly racist as to be simply stunning . there be no way I would let my kid watch this film . it be fine for adult I suppose who can approach the racism of this film with some sort of historical eye\/filter . do not think it be racist ? go onto a reservation tomorrow and yell `` redskin '' in a crowded room . yeah , I do not think so .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	I love this movie but unfortunately when i begin watch the dvd , it begin to freeze on certain scene then skip minute of a scene . Super disappoint that i pay for a damage dvd . the description say `` like new '' but it be obviously damage and the cover and disk look overuse with some previous owner 's name write all over it .

Movies_TV	POS	5	David Tennant pick up where Christopher Eccleston leave off without miss a beat . as the 10th and newest doctor , Tennant 's quirky Doc be refreshing and just funny enough to pull it off . he chemistry with Billie Piper , who play Rose Tyler , be fantastic as the drama intensify to a sad finale between the doctor and Rose . I recommend season 2 as a great buy and the additional extra on the dvd 's be fun to watch with all the behind scene , personal video diary and commentary . enjoy !
Movies_TV	POS	4	the animation be as good as any classic Disney . but the story be outdate . this movie be quite tell of its time . some folk who say they love it scare I about as much as the old soviet propaganda I grow up with . it be also `` wholesome '' back then . Bobby Driscoll as Peter Pan perfectly capture the tragedy of a child who have to mature and take on adult responsibility too soon . when in the middle of the final fight with Hook Wendy implore he to fly and he respond that he can not because he `` give he word '' it be just heartbreaking . those of we who grow up in the 70 be just lucky to have that burden lift and have normal prolonged childhood . and while Peter Pan be too adult , Hook in this version seem rather childish . like the most spoil kid you can imagine , Hook be a mean-spirited bully who constantly whine and throw tantrum . the worst punishment for he be the public humiliation of be call a codfish . he even escape the crocodile in the end . Smee be the ultimate Disney sidekick , a stutter moron who can not get anything right , a subservient character bully by all the other pirate . wendy be so proper for the 50s and so out of date today . a girl who know she place and just talk too much to avoid think about that . she can deal with other girl and play a mother to the boy but she know it be a man 's world . what make the red man red ? that be how it be , and that view be definitely outdate as well , but you can not cut a essential part of the movie out . the crocodile be the most wonderful thing in this movie , most adorable . and he swim to a great song too . overall , this be a classic movie worth see , but I would hesitate to show it to small kid . I think pg would be a more appropriate rating , indicate that significant portion of it would require explain to today 's child . but of course it would not occur to the Disney corporation to do a decent thing . or perhaps they really want we to go back to the 50 . some bonus feature on the dvd be quite interesting , feature Disney archive . the read-along story `` Peter 's Playful Prank '' be just horrible . there be so many thing wrong with that story ... just do not go there .
Movies_TV	POS	5	enemy of the state be a great move . that be why i give it a 5 star rating . a murder be catch on tape and now a man be run for he life .

First of all , wendy and she brother be not supopose to be tell story ABOUT Peter Pan ... the kid be not suppose to have hear of he !! so when Peter fly in , it be very anti-climatic . wendy be just like , oh , Peter , you be here finally . Yawn !! I think wendy have a lovely voice but the character be just annoying !! all she do be babble on while she sew Peters shadow . there be zero connection between Peter and Wendy , and that be a big problem . Tinkerbelle be the best character in this , but , she do not even get she famous death scene where everyone clap to bring she to life !! hook use a bomb to hurt Peter instead of poisoning he `` medicine '' be really lame . worst of all , with the exception of `` you can fly ! ' all of the song be lame . do I even have to mention the idiotic `` Red Man '' song ?? eww . plus , the lose boy be not suppose to be moron with retard voice . very dissapointing . this bland version be ok for little kid , but , to get the REAL story of Peter Pan , watch the new movie !!!

I be so glad too that Disney leave out the end where wendy grow up after all , get marry , and meet Peter Pan after so many year of separation . what a rotten ending , I have always think , so glad this version end differently . there be not really a moral to the story , just a fanciful adventure\/children 's story of innocent kid battle Captain Hook and he cohort . another Disney classic ! `` say you prayer , Hook !!!

Saw Peter Pan when I be three year old and enjoy it thoroughly again 37 and now 51 year later . it may not be highly refine , but it be irresistible nonetheless , and mile ahead of anything Disney have make in the past 30 year .  to those who want Disney to edit out the knife and gun , cast the Indians and female in they modern p.c. stereotype , and give Peter a monologue about save the environment in Never Land , keep in mind that when the studio get finish please not just you but everybody else with a gripe , there would be nothing left of the movie  or of much else write before the current age of political correctness .  give I Hamlet and Paradise lose exactly as they be create .

Movies_TV	NEU	3	I be glance at the other review and notice some reviewer wonder what become of the missing scene in which the audience be ask if they believe in faerie . the fact of the matter be this scene , which be vital to the original play , be purposely omit by Walt Disney be he animated version . in fact , when the Disney version appear in 1953 , many reviewer who be great fan of the Barrie play complain about this , among they , Bosley Crowther , film critic for the New York Times , and Herbert Brenon , a british director who make a very popular silent film version of Peter Pan in 1925 . why would Disney do this ? Crowther speculate that Disney assume that Americans be more literal mind in 1953 than they british counterpart be in 1904 -lrb- when the play be first stage -rrb- , and so would not buy into all that faerie stuff . also , Crowther sardonically add that perhaps Disney be afraid that Americans would find it simply too embarrassing to deal with too much `` pixiness . '' go figure . anyway , that be the story behind the missing scene .
Movies_TV	POS	4	I think that this be another great season . Great act , great storyline , pure win . also interesting that the doctor become romantically attach to Rose , but the way they break it off be also good . I be wonder if other universe mean there be other doctor ? anyways , the reason I give this 4 star instead of 5 be because of how much time the doctor spend on Earth . in the older series ' it seem like they be always go to other planet and exotic setting , and even though they special effect be primitive back then it still make for a interesting story . I think that I would like to see more exotic setting in the new Dr. who series and less time spend on earth , and that be wht I give it 4 star instead of 5 .

I highly recommend this .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this movie I believe be something most of we only wish could have be make . who do not want to see Cinderella maybe lose she happily ever after ? in the first movie she always seem to do she work with a sarcastic tone . she could not even get up out of bed , some maid !! I think this movie might be a little scary for some kid because the stepmother be really wicked this time . she break Cinderella 's slipper and then tell she to go `` clean it up '' . the best part be when the step mother use magic to trap Cinderella inside a pumpkin , and not that fancy coach this be inside with he seed and thorn grow all around it and Cinderella 's dress be all rip . Haha and Cinderella be so silly when she go `` but I dance with the prince '' and the stepmother just laugh at she ! also what really be amazing be that there be almost a unspoken theme in the movie the the King and Anastasia fall in love , if you have see this movie you know what I be talk about !! could this be a clue to a possible Cinderella 4 ?? Anastasia as Queen lol you decide !!

Movies_TV	POS	5	I never consider Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' to be one of they best animated classic up there with `` Bambi '' and `` Pinocchio , '' and it be while watch all of the extra that come with this platinum edition that I figure out why this be the case . much be make of Walt Disney 's affection for the J.M. Barrie 's story of the boy who would not grow up , and it dawn on I that I always identify more with Tom Swift , the boy inventor , than with Peter Pan . consequently I have develop a hypothesis that there be a choice to be make between Peter Pan and Tom Swift , similar to those we make between Superman and Batman , Elvis and the Beatles , Ginger and Mary Ann , etc. , as part of we pop culture consciousness . however , that be say , even those of we who be in a hurry to grow up can still enjoy Disney 's unique take on Peter Pan in this 1953 version . as most of we know from `` Finding Neverland '' or we own familiarity with the story of the story , `` Peter Pan '' be originally a stage production with actor be hoist on wire to fly , Tinker Bell be create by a flashlight , a actor play Nana and a young woman as Peter . Disney 's animated version have great fun make the character fly , turn Tinker Bell into a pantomime pixie who would become the icon of the Disney studio , and for the first time have the boy who never grow up be model and voice by a actual boy -lrb- Bobby Driscoll -rrb- . wendy be voice by Kathryn Beaumont , who have just do the title character Disney 's `` Alice in Wonderland , '' by vocally the show be steal by the great Hans Conreid as both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling , and Bill Thompson as the memorable Mr. Smee . one of the thing that prove the immortality of `` Peter Pan '' be how many different version of it work , each provide its own twist on the tale -lrb- my favorite be director P.J. Hogan 's 2003 film version , which I think be far and away the best version for adult -rrb- . here the emphasis be on Neverland as the greatest playground ever , where Captain Hook and Tinker Bell take turn steal the film . Peter Pan be a bit more of a imp here than elsewhere , but that be balance by the gravitas that Wendy bring to the proceedings . the only serious flaw here be the depiction of the Indians , although a consideration of the song `` what make the Red Man Red ? '' from the perspective of contemporary political correctness may still find the racism more silly than anything else . it go without say that these attitude be true to the time , and my preference have always be for point out these flaw rather than editing or ignore they . I might not consider this a top tier Disney film , but the dvd extra more than make up the difference , because once again we the studio treat its classic film the way all classic film should be treat on a 2-disc dvd set -lrb- which include a new digital restoration -rrb- . on Disc 1 there be a sneak peak for the upcome `` Tinker Bell '' computer animated movie , a opportunity to sing along with the movie 's song , and a storybook of `` Peter 's Playful Prank . '' then there be the audio commentary track be a compilation of interview clip `` host '' by Roy Disney . the commentary bear no relation to what be happen on screen so it really be just to be listen to and you will find that several of the bit appear in the featurette on Disc 2 . it be fascinating to listen to the likes of film critic\/historian Leonard Malting , animator Marc Davis -lrb- Tinker Bell -rrb- , Frank Thomas -lrb- Captain Hook -rrb- , and Ollie Johnston , along with actress Beaumont and Margaret Kerry -lrb- model for Tinker Bell -rrb- , and other . on Disc 2 you get to the Backstage Disney section , which include Walt Disney 's own explanation for `` why I make ` Peter Pan , ' '' a mini-documentary on `` the make of ` Peter Pan , ' '' and one of the highlight of the extra feature , `` the ` Peter Pan ' that almost be , '' that look at the evolution of the Disney version over the course of more than a decade . there be also a 1952 featurette on the film and Art Galleries consider hundred of gorgeous piece of original artwork do for the production . the Music & more section include the delete song `` the Pirate song '' and the lose song `` never land '' perform by Paige O'Hara , along with a music video of `` the second star to the Right '' perform by t-square . for Games & Activities there be a read-along version of the entire film , `` Camp Never Land : train to be a lose boy , '' `` Smee 's Sudoku Challenge , '' `` Tarrrget Practice , '' and `` Tink 's Fantasy Flight , '' all of which will appeal to the wee folk who be not familiar with play computer game on a actual computer . finally there be `` Peter Pan 's Virtual Flight , '' which I assume take we over a computer generate London prepare for the upcome `` Tinker Bell '' movie .

Movies_TV	NEU	3	` enemy of the State ' be a mostly enjoyable exercise in ` north by Northwest ' Lite . Will Smith be the professional who become a innocent on the run from both the bad guy and the law . the novelty in this case be that both be the same - and when the axis of evil have the resource of the State behind it , the odds be fairly stack against its enemy . of course , like Cary Grant in Hitchcock 's film , Smith be not really innocent - though essentially decent and a loving father , he be complacent , arrogant , politically apathetic , and have cheat on he wife . he have a oedipal problem to work through , have to put a bossy wife-mother in she place and supercede a father figure -lrb- brill -rrb- . the subsequent peril he undergo be a purgatorial chastening , a test he must take to prove himself a adequate , trustworthy family man again . anything that get in the way - be it the mob who threaten he client , or the woman he have the affair with - must be remove . it be good to remember this dubiously punitive aspect of the film whenever anyone talk about its liberal paranoia .  i nearly fall off my chair laugh when I read that certain critic who should know better take the film 's ` politics ' of paranoia seriously : some even suggest a family resemblance to Coppola 's ` the conversation ' -lrb- Gene Hackman play a similar character in both film -rrb- , one of the most difficult film in american cinema . ` enemy ' be not difficult or ambiguious or doubt - it know exactly what it stand for . unlike Hitchcock , who use he camera to implicate the viewer in he matrix of voyeurism , Scott 's camera stand outside the various weapon of surveillance of the film , uncover , rather than spy ; clarify , rather than obscure . unlike Coppola 's film , we know from the start who the enemy be and what he weapon be - it be merely a matter of be vigilant and get rid of he . yeah right .  Tony Scott be no more interested in political paranoia than he be in flag-waving or militarism in ` top gun ' . both narrative give he a structure within which he can practice he vision of total Cinema . so the best bit of ` enemy ' be the chase - the splattersome pursuit of Jason Lee ; the whole hotel sequence with Hackman , as Smith be seek by increasingly hysterical Feds ; and the tunnel run - even if these be more keystone than Keaton . it be less interesting when people make speech about privacy , the ` surveillance society ' and the connection between the telecommunications industry -lrb- whoop ! -rrb- and the military-industrial-complex -lrb- or whatever it be -rrb- . if I want to know about politics or threat to my civil liberty or establishment fascism in the US , I 'll go to a newspaper , NOT Hollywood . still , in the ` light ' of ` recent event ' , ` enemy ' have a lot more bite than it use to , with reference to both us-backed Afghans and pretzel .
Movies_TV	POS	5	the second series of Doctor who be much better then the first series . the acting of David Tennant really make the series so much better . also Billie Piper have grow in she acting skill and play well off of Tennant . here be my take on the episode rate with 4 be the best . the CHRISTMAS INVASION : the doctor be stick in bed most of the episode leave Rose to figure out how to stop a alien invasion . David Tennant play the doctor as if he always have be . \*\*\* NEW EARTH : the doctor take Rose to she first alien planet where and old enemy be wait for they . this be not my fav . episode but it do have some nice character moment . \*\* tooth and claw : the doctor and Rose find themselves in Scotland where they meet Queen Victoria , Evil Monks and a werewolf . Plotholes aside this be a very enjoyable episode . the special effect be some of the best i have see on the show . \*\*\* SCHOOL REUNION : the doctor investigate a school where strange thing be happen . this episode be very fun for two reason : the doctor meet some old friend -lrb- Sarah Jane Smith and K-9 !!! -rrb- also that jealousy that spark between Rose and Sarah Jane . also Anthony Stewart Head be great as the villian Mr. Finch . \*\*\* 1\/2 the girl in the fireplace : the doctor , Rose and Mickey arrive on a spaceship in the 54th century where they find timehole lead back to earth 's past . this episode be one of my top fav . \*\*\* 1\/2 rise of the cyberman : one of the Doctor 's greatest enemy be about to come to life on a parallel earth . this episode mark the return of the cyberman and Rose 's father . \*\*\* the age of STEEL : this episode be much darker then rise , but the dark atmoshpere add much to the story . also Mickey 's charater arc take a surprising turn . \*\*\* the idiot 's LANTERN : it be the 1950s and the coronation of the Queen just day away . people all over england be get turn into faceless zombie by they television . this be mostly a filler episode but with some fun bit . not my fav . but still enjoyable . the villian be also not that great . \*\* 1\/2 the impossible planet : the impossible have happen a planet orbit a blackhole . can the Doctor find out why before something deep within the planet awake ? this be a very fun episode and also a episode that not set on earth . \*\*\* 1\/2 the SATAN PIT : as Rose be threaten by the ood , the doctor face a anicent evil . this episode be a classic . \*\*\*\* love and monster : a ordinary man become obsess with the doctor and try to find he . this episode be not as bad as everyone say it be . the villian be dumb but the story show what happen to the people the doctor leave behind . \*\* 1\/2 fear her : another filler episode fill with some nice character bit . beware the giant scribble . \*\* army of ghost : Torchwood be reveal while the doctor be take prisoner . who be the Army of Ghosts ? Rose come into she own in this episode . a great episode . \*\*\*\* DOOMSDAY : as Torchwood and the world be invade , will the Doctor be able to save we ? a heartbreaking conclusion to a excellent season . a great episode with a somewhat offbeat cliffhanger . \*\*\*\*

Tinkerbell be portray pretty well in this version -lrb- spiteful and jealous of wendy -rrb- but they skip the fact that she mend they difference . in the movie , Peter be a fairly normal type of boy . in the book , he be wonderful , cocky , strong , and smart . the lose boy be just very different in the book . in the movie , they be cartoony , stupid , and slow , unlike the book . I agree that the portrayal of the redman be sort of incorrect in the movie , but it be not so different in the book . there be respect in both , although I think the visual be slightly insulting . hook be also very ugly in the movie , and describe as very cold and attractive in the book . overall , it just insult I how unlike the book it be . if you love the book , do not inch near this movie . if you have not read it , then proceed to this movie ... at you own risk !!!
Movies_TV	NEU	3	the first season of the new Dr. who be great stuff , and Eccleston be a marvellous blend of confidence trickster , scientific genius , and damage goods . the story be also uniformly excellent . the second season see David Tennant take thing in a more flippant direction -- this doctor be a little too blase for my liking , lack in intensity -lrb- save the occasional flash -rrb- and more smart-arsey . he strike I as a guy who know how the script will end , so the danger he face can be wise-cracked about rather fear and counter in desperation . self-referential humor , with a hint that everyone know it be just a tv show , might be fine for Monty Python or Ali G , but it be get no place in Dr. who . Tennant be skirt dangerously close the 1960 `` Batman . '' the second doctor , Patrick Troughton , be also jokey and humorous , but he never leave you think he be just a good actor in silly clothes act in a silly kid ' program . Tennant almost , but not quite , leave that impression . I do not like it . some of the story be also weak : the werewolf particularly so -lrb- what be they , what do they want , why do the come to earth -- no idea -rrb- , but also the coronation-day invasion by talk tv . formulaic , one could say . however , the Cybermen be excellent , and the double episode about the ood be also terrific . so this be solid Dr. who , but not the best . one hope season three will improve , particularly if tennant drop he shoulder-shrugging stand-up routine . and we can hope for some old monster 's back -- come on , BBC , what about give we some ice warrior , or Sea Devils , or Silurians ?

Movies_TV	POS	5	the second season of the `` Doctor who '' revival bring with it a new doctor -lrb- David Tennant -rrb- , a return companion -lrb- Billie Piper -rrb- , old friend , new enemy and a couple of old one as well . this dvd set cover all of season two and include the Children in Need special which cover event immediately follow the ninth doctor 's regeneration into the tenth . key story in this second season include `` the Girl in the fireplace , '' the quirky `` Love and Monsters , '' and the wonderfully excessive season finale , `` Army of Ghosts\/Doomsday . '' tennant slide into the role of the doctor seamlessly and appear to really be enjoy himself as he portray he childhood idol . while Eccleston 's doctor be fun , he have a very dark side lurk just beneath the surface . the dark side still live in Tennant , but he humorous and , quite frankly , cocky attitude suppress it for most of the episode in this season . I also see part of Peter Davison and Tom Baker 's portrayal of the doctor present in Tennant 's performance . Tennant 's Doctor have a very appealing demeanor and it be easy to get lose in he vision of the Timelord . Billie Piper reprise she role as Rose , the headstrong , curious companion of the doctor . as expect , hint of a romance be drop throughout the season , and take a humorous turn with the return of Sarah Jane Smith -lrb- the excellent Elisabeth Sladen -rrb- in `` School Reunion . '' Mickey , Jackie Tyler and Rose 's father , Peter , also return and take on bigger role this time around . Old enemy revisit include the always reliable Daleks and a revisioning of the Cybermen . although these new Cybermen be interesting , I miss the old version of the Doctor 's gold-resistant enemy . Cassandra , a new enemy in the new series , also make a return in a interesting story that touch on medical ethic . New enemy include include a extra-terrestrial werewolf in `` Tooth and Claw '' and maybe even the Devil himself in `` the Satan pit . '' in `` the Girl in the fireplace , '' we be introduce to some sinisterly silent clockwork android . `` fear she '' give we a non-enemy in a truly touching story about a child who miss its family . overall , the new enemy be good , especially the werewolf in a legitimately suspenseful tale . special feature include in this set include video diary from Tennant and Piper , as well as run commentary on each episode . once again , we get to look a bit deeper into the production of the show in the `` Doctor who Confidential '' segment . highlight include the `` School Reunion '' Confidential which catch old fan up with Sladen and K-9 , and the `` Girl in the fireplace '' confidential that include a look at the read through of the story . overall , this season of `` Doctor who '' be a excellent addition to the wonderful catalogue of the Doctor 's many adventure . while Peter Davison will always be my favorite , David Tennant 's Doctor will struggle for second place with Patrick Troughton 's doctor until the end of time . if you be not familiar with the old series , have no worry . this set can be watch with no previous knowledge of the original . it might be helpful to watch season one in order to pick up on a few thing but that , too , be not necessary . if you be a fan of intelligent , quirky and sometimes hilarious science fiction , the second season of `` Doctor who '' be just what you need . I highly recommend this set .

Movies_TV	POS	5	great movie ! we son be 3 and love to pretend to fly . plus , TinkerBell 's extreme emotion have give we a great oppotunity to talk about how we exercise self-control and how we express we feeling . great entertainment and easy `` teachable moment . ''
Movies_TV	POS	4	unlike Chris E. David Tennent be not one to go pound moral down you skull -lrb- though I do like Escleston 's energy and dynamics -rrb- David Tennent 's `` Tenth '' , himself be not in foulable in he mishap . Tennent 's 10th who , -lrb- who -rrb- I also think do quite well in `` Cassanova '' be a silly eccentric with more on be a crazy imperfect himself and eccept that than be obligate to appologize afterwards as do Chris E. . Billy Piper odviously do not speek `` Pig Common '' though as she fake accent sometimes faulter in situation that Pig Common can not artiqulate as in the bazaar sci-fus word and reaction to alien . usually she come off fine in normal situation that call for the Pig Common charm . Might I suggest try to emulate Peter Woodthorpe who be the `` scum of theive '' in he speech . also he be Gollumn in the Baski Lord of the ring . the boyfreind be a backwheel and depict k-9 as such insulting both character as be as such when they could be more pivotal and take more seriously by the audience if thing be just leave to roll on . Doc # 9 hate everyone in Rose 's life except Rose herself and this alienate the audience -lrb- at least I -rrb- from he . Tennent do this but to a lesser degree . -lrb- and it be a good thing to a degree -rrb- the irreprotiable 9 and 10 be both much like Tom Baker and Chris E. be more on William Hartnel with the exception that Tom Baker do not leave people to die becasue of questionable `` character '' as do Escleston -lrb- even will Hartnel 's 1st be merciful to we moron . -rrb- . Tennent have move away from the mondane and moralistic modernizaton of Earth and it be reala t show feel and be more like the doctor -lrb- s -rrb- of old . though the feel be still the way escleston 's story and atmopshere be which I do not really like . it be still entertaining and fun with tenent and though I like Escleston 's early one -lrb- usually writen by Russel Davies himself -rrb- he later one be more like Stargate and the cheapness of sci-fus channel stuff and it be P.C. feel . Briton have a weird way of conveigh idea to the audiance and I prefer the tone down morality check of tenent and even Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee who be more into the entertainment area than the informative area . k-9 be not a second bannana to the companion ! Sarah Jane be not a `` Ender '' or a dead wash-out as `` she make I smile in the end '' as the song -lrb- from she heyday -rrb- go .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I be introduce to DW not too long ago and I fall in love with it . I start with the original series very first 3 arc and have jump around the series ever since . the new series be just as enjoyable , if not more so , than the original , and now that i be up to season 4 , i have to say this have be my favorite so far . David Tennant and Billi Pipper play off each other so well , that what make this season so great . they have great chemistry together on screen . add to that some great story line from this series -lrb- the Christmas Invasion , School Reunion , rise of the Cyberman , Age of Steel , the impossible planet , Satan pit , Army of Ghosts , Doomsday -rrb- really add to just how great this series 2 really be . I highly recommend this to anyone who be a fan of the series or who be try to get into it , its great !
Movies_TV	NEG	2	for a suspense movie , it be not very suspensful . Will Smith play a poor character , with a weak support cast . the plot be good , but poorly execute . maybe worth a rental , but I would not buy it .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be one of the only movie heavily portray computer and technology that do not make I gag and cough . sure there be a few flaw here and liberty take there , but overall , it be awesome and frighteningly realistic -- almost too savvy for a general-audience movie . a lot go into this movie and it show .  as for the guy who be rag on it and could not believe that kind of monitoring could be go on , all I can say be ignorance be bliss . maybe he have not hear about Echelon .
Movies_TV	POS	4	its great to see Hackman reprise he operative character from `` the conversation '' .  the point of this film as to how far along we be towards `` 1984 '' and `` Big Brother '' be perhaps indicate by we lack of alarm about it . its interesting what the situational awareness the Feds can gain by have a emittor on the Will Smith character , its instructive conceptually as to how you could steer yourself and other unit to intercept or stay close without get too close . but this technology be show to collapse when the sensor be not `` cheating '' by the emittor and have to use line-of-sight collection mean to stay in contact with they prey in a cluttered urban environment . if you watch the film conceptually as a demonstration of military and possibly totalitarean technology its worth 4 star . if you watch it for entertainment and plausibility it lack realism since if the corrupt Feds want the Will Smith character 's tape they would have barge in , kill he and make it look like something else . of course there would be no film and chase then .  we should reject violently these `` reality '' tv show where such totalitarean surveillance means be take in jest like its a mere popularity contest : if you become a `` enemy of the state '' you get vote to be `` banish '' might not be a laughing matter .
Movies_TV	POS	5	excellent theme , plot , and act . effect be great and the gadget be cool . the language be pretty bad but the movie keep you on the edge of you seat ask question like , what will happen next ? or , be he gonna die ? I recommend this movie as a great action movie !

I love all the crazy alien and cheesy effect and most of all the awesome theme song . now the doctor be back and the show be better than ever . I like CE 's doctor but DT 's be amazing and he hit the character right on the head . the effect be still a bit cheesy but that what make the show timeless and great . the write on the show be some of the best in tv history and the support cast be wonderful as well . I can not wait for season 3 ! best episode in my opinion be the Girl in the Fireplace .
Movies_TV	POS	5	enemy of the state star will Smith and Gene Hackman . neither of these fine actor make a bad movie that I know of . this be a fine thriller movie about government surveillance and a bad national security agent play by Jon Voight . the good news be that the surveillance technology feature in this movie be for real and target against US enemy . the bad news be that sometimes the government thing we be the enemy .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	I would enjoy this a lot more if Hemalayaa be not constantly make ` sexy eye ' at the camera . it be a shame , the dance move be fun and you can get a reasonable workout from this video . but while you be work out , the instructor will be stare at you like you be a white chocolate and raspberry muffin , which be a bit off-putting .

Prince charming finally get a personality , and he be such a wonderful character ! the animation and voice be so well do that I believe this could have make it in the theater ! even the song be very enjoyable , though Disney sequel song often leave a great deal to be desire . skip Cinderella II and go right to this movie !
Movies_TV	POS	4	okay , even if the 3d `` interpolation '' bit be more than a stretch , the rest of the movie stay well within the reach of not-too-unreasonable suspicion . who know what more than 20 acre of underground computing facility can produce ? -lrb- and do not let anybody tell you they have not get such thing , especially if they live within 100 mile of Fort Meade , MD. -rrb- sprinkled amidst imaginative depiction of technical espionage , you 'll also find historically accurate reference to the NSA 's situation in Iran in the early eighty , a discreetly present faraday cage , and maybe a occasional NSA in-joke ...

Movies_TV	NEU	3	it be SAD that DISNEY have become the MULTIZILLION DOLLAR INSTITUTION that it have . if it be still under the WATCHFUL CARING EYES of WALT DISNEY HIMSELF , I do not THINK the dvd version of THIS movie I just purchase WOULD be the same . the movie of COURSE be as great as it always was - a wonder of ARTISTRY & FANTASY SEAMLESSLY blend together . the color be as beautiful as ever . the SOUND be O.K. , BUT I would THINK that DISNEY COULD DO SOMETHING in the way of restoration as far as the HISS that be very noticeable - especially in the louder passage .  i ALSO AM no DUMMY when it come to GENERAL dvd knowledge , but I be totally confused look at the back of the dvd case as to WHETHER THIS MOVIE WAS A WIDESCREEN VERSION or FULL SCREEN . it clearly state in miniscule letter under the run time that PETER PAN be PRESENTED in ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL ASPECT RATIO , APPROX . 1.33:1 . I -lrb- and probably anyone else besides ROGER EBERT -rrb- WOULD GUESS that this mean it appear as it be originally show in THEATRES - WIDESCREEN ! I be more than tick to find LATER that it be in fact a pan and scan version , and after pay not a SMALL SUM of MONEY , I feel a little rooked .  my suggestion be to keep watch that WORN OUT VHS COPY UNTIL DISNEY decide to invest a little more in one of their crown achievement . oh and do not WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT that LIMITED ISSUE NONSENSE MEANING that THEY ONLY MANUFACTURE EACH MOVIE TITLE ON A LIMITED NUMBER RUN ONLY once per generation -lrb- with DISNEY , GENERATIONS be BORN QUITE OFTEN -rrb- . right now , THEY OBVIOUSLY be have a gigantic case of TIGHTWADITIS and YET be still pricing THEIR TITLES WELL above OTHER studio . sad , sad , sad !  i ONLY HOPE WE all can see this movie in ITS FULL WIDESCREEN GLORY and SOUND SOON ! PETER PAN in ITSELF be still magical !

Movies_TV	NEU	3	in this third dvd edition of the Disney classic , the color have be drastically alter , the contrast be subdue and the bitrate be not very high . the color be slant , not so much towards yellow as towards gold . everything be imbue with a golden glow which make Tinker Bell the real heroine of the story and bring out the golden highlight on everything from Mr. Darling 's cuff link to the golden ornament on Hook 's ship . Peter Pan 's tunic be at time almost goldenrod instead of Lincoln green . there be no true blue sky , just a variant of egyptian Blue . neverland sometimes look like you lazy neighbor 's parch garden . the sky be often milky white or beige . the red and blue wallpaper in the darling child 's bedroom be now brownish . Mermaid lagoon have lose its greenery and turn a repulsive labium pink ... the funny thing be , once you accept that the action take place in Neverland in the fall , with lot of brown , yellow and orange leaf everywhere , you sort of learn to like it . it be a wild , one might say `` experimental '' , concept that must have be arrive at after much joint-smoking at DTS Digital image -lrb- the restorer -rrb- . it be not so much a restoration as a revision . and then , not so much a Technicolor restoration as a eastmancolor restoration -lrb- little joke here -rrb- . it be very strange . on the down side , the Redskins have turn a politically correct pink . on the plus side , every brown and yellow surface be make to shine unnaturally , even at night , and lot of thing be visible in the dark that be not before . the reverse be true in the daytime . more revisionism : I notice a slight shimmy in the London cityscape at night just before the camera pan up to Neverland have be eliminate in this version . can they do that ? in the indoor scene , this slant towards yellow make sense as it replicate the warm , nostalgic , homey glow of lamplight . otherwise ... the best thing I can say be that it give the viewer a brand new -lrb- though some might say old-fashioned -rrb- perspective on a film he be see maybe too often and the total effect be dream-like and reminiscent of a yellowed full-colour illustration in a old picture book . a quick look at the numerous art gallery in the extra will remind you that there should have be a whole lot more green and blue everywhere accord to the original artwork . as the picture be slightly zoom out compare to previous version , this too add to the majesty and delicacy of the action . it be less `` in you face '' . where the pe really shine , though , be in the sound department which might persuade I to buy this edition -lrb- I only rent -rrb- . the whole soundtrack -lrb- dialog , singing voice , orchestra , sound effect -rrb- have be completely rethought , refurbish and rechannel creatively for 5.1 -lrb- in french and spanish too -rrb- . there be a lot of work evident also in the original mono track . but in the enhance home theater mix -lrb- the word `` enhance '' appear three time on the cover -rrb- , very interesting thing happen . the dialog be mostly in the center speaker but the music come regularly through the other four speaker . at some point , individual instrument be make to come through all the surround speaker -lrb- like the harp , when Peter appear on the rooftop , instead of the flute , like you might guess -rrb- . the sound of instrument and voice have be give more resonance . it be less harsh , dry or abrupt . the child voice be almost bearable in this version . there be nothing grate in the brass or in any other part of the orchestra . everything sound modern , natural and free-flowing . of course , the sound effect have be amplify with bass and the mix make good use of directional effect -lrb- Tinker Bell 's glockenspiel and celeste , the crocodile 's tick clock , Peter 's ghostly voice in Skull Rock -rrb- . the whole film become a symphony where the music take center stage without overshadow the character voice , which be now disentangle from the surrounding music . this be another element that add to the dream-like quality of the whole and one that I like very much . by comparison , the 5.1 mix of the special edition -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and the 4.0 mix of the limited edition -lrb- 1999 -rrb- be only fat , untreated mono with lot of harshness in the loud passage and instability in the soft one . well ... consider the radical change make to the color palette , maybe they could have call this the `` Golden Slumbers Edition '' or `` Pixy dust Edition '' or , better still `` global warming edition '' ... and it be not something you can correct with the Tint button -lrb- which add red or green -rrb- or with the Cold setting -lrb- which add a little blue -rrb- . but it be perfect if you be sound-oriented and a improve sound be very important to you , if you have no memory of what `` Peter Pan '' use to look like or if you really picture Hook 's harpsichord as be make of solid gold .
Movies_TV	POS	5	my kid can not get enough of this story-they act it out and view the dvd nonstop since new year holiday . it be a wonderful product

I think I have a bad tape , so I call Disney and they tell I that somewhere in editing , they have make a mistake , and forget to put the documentary on the tape . ooops ! avoid the mess and just get the dvd .

Movies_TV	POS	5	Director Tony Scott 's ENEMY of the state be a engaging thriller . this film cover territory frequently traverse by Alfred Hitchcock , namely that of `` the wrong man '' be place in jeopardy without any plausible explanation . brilliantly play , Will Smith be that man . this film run at a breakneck pace as the NSA pursue Smith for something he unwittingly have be hand . Smith eventually become team with Gene Hackman who play a former NSA operative on the lamb . Hackman 's character here seem base on he character from Francis Ford Coppola 's the conversation . Gene Hackman be very good at what he do and he steal this film in the process . the pace be frenetic with the latest high tech surveillance devise include satellite gp system track Smith and Hackman 's every move . the climax be riveting with NSA bad guy Jon Voight and mob boss Tom Sizemore buck head . composer Trevor Rabin 's contribution to the score be very effective . Gabriel Byrne have a brief but pivotal scene . this be a good one .
Movies_TV	POS	4	the plot be excellent , gene hackman and will smith be excellent but one thing that get I extremely aggravate be the innaccurate portrayal of the NSA and they agent , especially the agent , I mean who on earth be gonna believe seth green jack black and all those actor from go in 60 seconds and save private ryan be real nsa agent , they acting be so off and i could never for a second believe any of they have the intelligence nor the ability to work for any federal agency other than the post office . if you be gonna choose bad guy , choose bad guy that we can believe be truely bad not just dim-witted .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I have like all the version of Peter Pan make over the year -lrb- such as hook , and more recently P.J.

Movies_TV	POS	5	if season 1 be a bit slow to start only to finish on a high note , season 2 pick up quality-wise where season 1 stop , and get better along the way . the script be definitely better write and less fill with hole and short cut . David Tennant as the new doctor be very different from Christopher Eccleston -lrb- more London , less northern -rrb- , and I think I prefer Eccleston , but that be not to say that Tennant 's performance be not great , and very enjoyable . a hugely entertaining series .
Movies_TV	POS	5	I see the trailer and think this movie would suck . but once I step in the theater , I be utterly impressed . Will Smith deliver a wonderful performance show we a new side to he mistique . I think it make we all wonder about technology . before anyone get crazy , that cant really happen , ok . still the thought be entertaining : = -rrb-
Movies_TV	POS	5	my daughter -lrb- 3 year -rrb- and I enjoy this movie as much as the original . really pleased and surprised on how entertaining it be . save you money , and forgo the Cinderella II .
Movies_TV	POS	4	the critic be not fair to this one . it be one of the best look , best act , most well write action\/suspense film I have ever see . yes , it have the obvious car crash , high speed and on foot chase , shootout , and explosion , but this movie use basic intelligence as its main drive force . the other action movie cliche that I just mention be use very wisely and sometimes very funny . this be one of the most well think out action movie I have ever see , and I highly recomend it .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	a very long and boring movie to say the least . it be way too confusing and have enough story for 3 movie . it get too frantic sometimes and the end be all mess and keep I way too confused . not enough explain . good act though -lrb- which be what save it -rrb- but there be way to much empty space in between .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be one film which use modern technology in one of the most useful way . the main draw of the film other than the excellent , all-star cast -lrb- will Smith , Gene Hackman , Jon Voight , Gabriel Byrne . . -rrb- be the clever use of editing and camera technology to draw suspense and awe to a viewer . Smith 's paranoid performance be the best of he career -lrb- hate he in id4 and mib -rrb- and Gene Hackman -lrb- good guy finally -rrb- basically reprise he character from the conversation in he best performance of all he seemingly endless action-thriller . I think this be Jerry Bruckheimer 's best film yet . . intelligent , witty , suspenseful , well-acted , well-directed , polished .
Movies_TV	NEG	1	this movie be HORRIBLE . it be another example of Hollywood 's distortion of fact . there be absoulutly no way the NSA or anyone else could do the thing that this movie profess that they can . no computer in the world , no matter how powerful , can `` rotate '' a fix image . not to mention the fact that there be no way that there be camera everywhere ! by the way , satellite be retask in a matter of hour , not seconds . there be not a single facet of this movie which I consider to be valid . I have to stop watch it because I be so disgusted . please ! do not encourage the production of more movie like this one by buy it !

I would hope all movie could make some sort of statement such as that . the plot be what make this movie a winner . except for a unsatisfying ending , I like this film .
Movies_TV	NEU	3	this be a video I wish I could love , but that just do not do it for I . part of it be sheer silliness - flubb the lip in the warm-up ? - and part of it be that Hemalayaa 's narration style bother I . -lrb- it might work for other people , but I find she to be a bit too flip . -rrb- there be the occasional odd transition , and the background dancer be sometimes do something completely different from what Hemalayaa be demonstrate , which be confuse - be it a modification for more\/less advanced viewer ? be it bad cue ? what ? as far as the workout go , it be actually pretty fun . the move might not necessarily be Bollywood , but they have get enough of the flavor to offer something different from a lot of the dance-style video out there . the move be generally easy enough for anyone to follow , although people with bad knee may find the emphasis on knee movement to be difficult or painful ; it be more high-impact than not , with a fair amount of hop in the workout proper . there be a lot of repetition , which make pick up the move very easy but which can make thing a little boring . overall , this video be a mixed bag for I . the workout be enjoyable but the narration be not , and the hop may be a bit much for a lot of people . I would recommend try to find this at a local library before buy it , I think .
Movies_TV	NEG	2	when I buy the Peter Pan special edition I have forget the racist portrayal of the Indians in the movie . they do live in Neverland but will kid make the distinction that if they live in Neverland it be make believe ? will they understand that not all Indians say Ugg and how like the one in this movie ? I do not remember the `` what make the Red Man Red '' number from when I be kid but that be before video . now kid can watch it over and over again . also , my copy do not have the `` making of '' short even though it say it do on the case . this be very disappointing because I be hope it would address the racism issue .
Movies_TV	POS	5	this be a really fun workout dvd , and totally accessible to anyone . grant , I be not a fitness guru but I do try to get 20 to 40 minute of moderate exercise most day and this certainly count . I be certain it be not the most intense kick you butt workout on the market , but it make I sweat , feel great and do not bear I to tear . the exercise be a nice mix of fun\/sexy -lrb- without make I feel trashy -rrb- and I do not feel the need to have any dance ability to get something out of it . -lrb- of course my husband be ban from the room when I do the workout -rrb- after enough time watch the dvd with the instruction , I be able to mute the sound and play some high energy music on top of it to keep it fresh and more cater to my style . I do skip a couple of move that my body do not like , but I just dance around the music instead . it be a great stress relief ! I would highly recommend this dvd for anyone look to keep active but want something a little more fun than a regular workout dvd .

Movies_TV	POS	5	this movie be so great , it be hard to put into word ... the action move so fast , and the camera just as fast ... I nominate this for the Oscar for best film editing ! this movie submerge you into the action , Will Smith give a very strong performance , as do the know-it-all character play by Gene Hackman I highly recommend this film to anyone seek thrill ! Jason Lee also give a strong stint as the guy who discover the film of the assassination .
Movies_TV	POS	5	help the young to believe they can still survive & ` fly away ' awhile , out of the chaos all around they .
Movies_TV	POS	5	fear this dvd set , at least if you be press for time . a season full of thoroughly entertaining , enjoyable science fiction tv episode straight from the UK be to be find within , and the temptation to put the next disc in and keep watch be terribly hard to resist . David Tennant certainly have some pretty big shoe to fill -lrb- nine pair of they , actually -rrb- , but he have really do a wonderful job in take on the role of the eccentric space\/time-wandering doctor . he be as delightfully quirky as ever , yet in a more hyperactive manner . full of frenetic humor and yet less distant emotionally , with more warmth and less sarcasm than he immediate predecessor . this make he a bit more likeable but also a bit too human perhaps ; it be easier to forget that he be not of this earth , although trace of # 9 's convincingly alien mean streak remain . and he oddball sense of wonder in the face of the unknown -- even werewolf have a certain `` beauty '' for he . in general , Tennant 's Doctor will prove to be a memorable one , I suspect , faithfully true to the character 's general persona while engagingly eccentric in its own very unique way . the storytelling have thankfully improve very much since the prior season . do not get I wrong , I like `` the complete First Series '' quite a bit , but this second time around the plotline seem less rush and the solution less sudden and out of left field . more of the story be two-parter , which help immensely in this regard . after all , the good old classic `` Doctor who '' tale gradually develop through four episode of about half a hour each ; two hour-long episode back-to-back amount to much the same thing , which may be about the ideal time necessary for a Doctor who plot to unfold . this season have a good mix of story too . many be good solid straight science fiction , and this be especially so of `` rise of the Cybermen '' -lrb- okay , even if the Cybermen 's inventor do seem like a carbon copy of Davros -rrb- , and along the same line the Doomsday battle between two classic Doctor who foe in the season finale be totally and utterly inspire !

'' which make no sense . there be some good one , but very few . I get bore with the repetition . you will get you heart rate up since she incorporate a lot of hop ... like hop 3x in a row to one side , hop & wiggle you glut , then the other many time or other move like a pony from the 50s in a indian style or other move that have knee lift . the idea be there , but I still do not like Hemalayaa 's style or think she ability to dance be good enough to be teaching . I find myself follow the background dancer who know the routine instead . if you want a hybrid indian dance that be corny , silly & help you let go because it be easy & silly , this be for you . you can see a preview at the distributer Acacia com
Movies_TV	NEU	3	it be SAD that DISNEY have become the MULTIZILLION DOLLAR INSTITUTION that it have . if it be still under the WATCHFUL CARING EYES of WALT DISNEY HIMSELF , I do not THINK the dvd version of THIS movie I just purchase WOULD be the same . the movie of COURSE be as great as it always was - a wonder of ARTISTRY & FANTASY SEAMLESSLY blend together . the color be as beautiful as ever . the SOUND be O.K. , BUT I would THINK that DISNEY COULD DO SOMETHING in the way of restoration as far as the HISS that be very noticeable - especially in the louder passage .  i ALSO AM no DUMMY when it come to GENERAL dvd knowledge , but I be totally confused look at the back of the dvd case as to WHETHER THIS MOVIE WAS A WIDESCREEN VERSION or FULL SCREEN . it clearly state in miniscule letter under the run time that PETER PAN be PRESENTED in ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL ASPECT RATIO , APPROX . 1.33:1 .

Movies_TV	POS	5	the BBC 's new production of its classic series , Doctor who , weather its first major casting change admirably . most actor remain in the lead role for at least three year , but for Christopher Eccleston , one year be enough , and he doctor -lrb- aka ` nine ' -rrb- die in the season one finale . in keep with who tradition , the Doctor , upon he death , regenerate into a completely new body . take the TARDIS control from Eccleston be another Russell t Davies alumnus , David Tennant -lrb- who headline Davies ' production of casanova -rrb- as the tenth incarnation of the doctor -lrb- aka ` ten ' -rrb- . Tennant have he work cut out for he , follow Eccleston 's marvelous turn as the Time Lord , but he make the transition so seamlessly that the character truly seem like the same man in a different body . aid this transition be largely the same writing and production staff , as well as the same co-star -lrb- Billie Piper as Rose Tyler -rrb- and support cast -lrb- Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith -rrb- . it be to Tennant 's credit that he not only immediately put he own stamp on the character but maintain Eccleston 's level of chemistry with the support cast . ten be physically younger than nine , more brash , more impulsive , less torment by guilt , but still achingly lonely . he loneliness become a run theme throughout the season , touch on in nearly every episode . Eccleston play the doctor as he play Steve Baxter in Davies ' the second coming -lrb- a tormented otherworldly be -rrb- ; Tennant play the doctor as casanova -lrb- a young , lovelorn romantic hero -rrb- . the Doctor 's romantic attachment , in fact , become the vehicle by which Davies explore the central theme of loneliness . ten and Rose build upon and deepen the romance that nine and Rose begin in the first season . they love be palpable ; they be often literally willing to die for each other . in the UK , the series be family-oriented and rarely stray beyond the pg level , so this romance be never physically consummate ; the character do not even kiss . despite this -- in fact , because of it -- they feeling be all the more poignant . -lrb- and how often do we see a depiction of true and abide love on television that do not involve some kind of bump-and-grind ? -rrb- by the end of the season , the relationship have come full circle : the Doctor have teach Rose all he can ; it be time for she to leave he and put to use all the thing she be learn . they final separation be tragic but yet also hopeful : despite the sadness , the viewer know Rose will thrive in she new environment . Billie Piper 's send-off could not have be more positive or more lovingly write -lrb- and it leave open the possibility of she return to the series in the future for a guest spot -rrb- . nobody who leave who be ever truly go . the tremendous `` School Reunion '' bring back a old fan favorite , Sarah Jane Smith -lrb- Elisabeth Sladen -rrb- . again , romance be the means by which Davies explore the Doctor 's impact on he companion ' life . the story be beautifully write : suspenseful , funny , romantic , and poignant . Sladen slip back into the role effortlessly , and Anthony Stewart Head provide a wonderful villain in the sinister Mr. Finch . romance also infuse the imaginative `` Girl in the Fireplace , '' in which a army of clockwork repair droid from the fifty-first century stalk Madame de Pompadour -lrb- Sopia Myles -rrb- . the doctor be clearly smite with the young Reinette , but the episode 's conclusion showcase how the heartbreakingly short human lifespan will always thwart such attachment . but romance be not all the second season have to offer : old foe return -lrb- Daleks , Cybermen , Cassandra -rrb- as well as old friend -lrb- Harriet Jones , Sarah Jane , K-9 , Pete Tyler , the Face of Boe -rrb- . also , the setting finally get away from Earth for a few episode , and there be a couple of trip to Earth 's past . the recur character develop beautifully , especially Mickey Smith , who finally come into he own as a hero . particularly good be the two-part story `` the impossible planet '' \/ `` the Satan pit , '' which find the doctor and Rose in a bleak space station on a planet perpetually circle a black hole . but the real standout of the season might well be `` the Christmas Invasion , '' a hour-long special that air on Christmas day , 2005 . this episode allow the support character -- and by extension the viewer -- a opportunity to adjust to the new doctor , and it allow ten to establish he heroic bona fide . the guest cast be marvelous , particularly Penelope Wilton as the UK 's new prime minister , Harriet Jones . a argument between the PM and ten at the episode 's conclusion be brilliant , worthy of the West wing , show that Davies be not afraid to challenge he viewer ' perception of heroism and villainy . other highlight of the season be `` the rise of the Cybermen '' \/ `` the age of Steel , '' the chill `` Tooth and Claw , '' the off-beat `` love and monster , '' and of course , the brilliant finale , `` Army of Ghosts '' \/ `` Doomsday . '' of all the episode , only the disjointed `` fear she '' feel sub-par . the overall quality of the season be remarkable , give the amount of backstage shuffling that take place -lrb- e.g. , the timing of Piper 's departure be initially unclear ; a few episode undergo last-minute rewrite -rrb- . and yet another challenge loom ahead for Davies as he reinvent the show in the wake of `` Doomsday , '' which write out literally the entire support cast . only two season in , and a era have already end . much of the season 's success be owe to Tennant , who have quickly establish himself as one of the most popular doctor in the show 's long history . he own love for the series and the character shine through every moment he be on scene , and he effortlessly convey the Doctor 's past through he expression , body language , and vocal inflection . if Eccleston be `` Doctor Modern , '' Tennant be `` Doctor Classic-Modern , '' meld perfectly the older and more contemporary portrayal of the character . he chemistry with Piper be nothing short of magical , and he also play wonderfully off the supporting and guest actor . as with the first season , the second season be best view in pristine dvd rather than the hacked-up version show on tv . the boxed set include the usual extra ; viewer should make the Pudsey Cutaway \/ Children in Need special they first stop -- it be a essential prologue to `` the Christmas Invasion . '' season two be proof positive that Doctor who can hold its own with pretty much anything else currently on television .

I remember watch she the first time round and it be both touching and very sad to see how the after affect of travel with the doctor effect she . . the story ` the girl in the firplace ' be also well write and act . it also make I cry . doctor have to have at least 1 scary story and ` the tooth and the claw ' fill that criterion . by the end of the series though I be tire of Rose . she be loud and brash and frankly too immature for the Doctor 's interest to be crediable . the finale be well write but I be quite numb to Rose 's pain as she end most of the episode in tear and I be rather glad to see she go .
